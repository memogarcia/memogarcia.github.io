## Dynamic floor arrangement

Imagine a building where all the rooms, doors, lights, and temperature controls are automated and can be controlled from a central location. This is similar to a software-defined network (SDN), where network devices such as switches, routers, and firewalls can be controlled from a central location using software.


In this building, the building automation system (BAS) acts as the central controller for all the systems in the building. Similarly, in an SDN, the controller acts as the central point of control for all the network devices.

The controller in an SDN communicates with the network devices using a protocol called OpenFlow. This protocol allows the controller to program the behavior of the network devices, such as the path a packet should take through the network, and the actions that should be taken on the packet.

The OpenFlow protocol is like the language spoken by the building automation system in our building analogy. Just like the building automation system speaks a language that the systems in the building understand, the OpenFlow protocol is a language that the network devices in an SDN understand.

The advantages of SDN are similar to the advantages of a building automation system. In a building automation system, the BAS can optimize energy consumption, reduce maintenance costs, and improve comfort for occupants. Similarly, in an SDN, the controller can optimize network performance, reduce maintenance costs, and improve the user experience.

In conclusion, SDN can be thought of as a building automation system for computer networks. Just like a building automation system can improve the efficiency and comfort of a building, SDN can improve the performance and reliability of computer networks.
