* Define the scope of the problem
    * Avoid ambiguous words when defining your scope, for example, _a maintainable solution_ … what is that?

* Make a solution able to adapt to changes and requirements.

> There is no such thing as the perfect architecture, but there are definitely bad architectures. Identify them as soon as possible.

</br>

* Identify what matters for your system.
    * What do you care the most?
        * performance?
        * resiliency?
        * consistency?
        * something else?
* What matters changes from system to system.

* Don’t spend extra cost on performance (or some other metric) if that’s not required.

> Identify the key characteristics of your system and let that guide your architecture

</br>

* An architect should also organize teams, because a team structure should reflect the solution architecture.
	* A system is the reflection of the organization that created it… so you must change your organization if you want something “different” or “new”
