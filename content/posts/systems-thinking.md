## What is a system?

A set of pieces that work together to perform a function with purpose. Out of it, emergence arises!

Emergence as a concept refers to the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. New properties and behaviors emerge at the system level that cannot be understood by analyzing the parts in isolation.
