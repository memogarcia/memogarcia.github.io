embrace
    randomness
        whatever happens, happens
        do a random "nice thing" for someone every day
        enjoy the little detours

    discomfort
        boredom
        fasting

    people
        stronger toguether
            people are more willing to take risks if they trust their team
            sacriface for others

stoic
    low expectations -> high rewards

soul
    don't be afraid to mix work and life
        remember your work is what you left behind
        is what you share with others

authenticity
    is not being unique, is to speak for yourself
    say no when you mean it
    understand WHY you do things, not only how
    form your own opinions
    the fact that you have an opinion, doesnt make it better than someone else

strive to improve
    don't be afraid to fail
    your enemy should become your teacher
    rival vs competitor
    always learn something new
        NEVER NEVER NEVER laught at ignorance because is the thing you know who has it but you never know if you have it.

teach

respect
    empaty
        sonder
    your work
    other people's time
        is the only thing they cannot recover

simple living
    minimalist
    consume local and in season
        improve the economy by make it more distributed

values
    make your decisions based on your values
        people can depend on you if you are consistent

rest
    sleep
    travel
    disconnect from work
        computers, screens

have a clear vision, don't be obsesed with the road because that could change, your vision should stay the same

but more importantly, how to follow?

I want to be like Rodrigo or Spike, but does my life style allows this?
how to let more art in my life?

how to write this post?

What makes people consistent?
