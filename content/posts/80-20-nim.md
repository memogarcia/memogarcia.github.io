aka Pareto principle.

I’ve been writing python for more than 10 years now and I’m at the point that I can write python code as naturally as I would write Spanish or English, however, my honeymoon period is gone. Python, as pleasant as it is to write code it has some disadvantages that I’m not willing to deal with anymore.

1. Sharing code requires the right interpreter + pip registry access on the target environment (difficult on airgapped environments)… you can use nuitka or similar tools but not that many people are familiar with it.
2. It is slow… using tools like numpy, numba, etc helps a lot but then see problem 1
3. `There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it.`  yeah sure.

I was hesitating between 3 languages:

1. Go
2. Rust
3. Nim

And I decided for Nim. mostly because is fast enough and the ergonomics are something I’m used to.

I would love to learn Go _and_ Rust but honestly I like to use my free time for something else.

So, how to ease the transition between Python and Nim?

Some of the things I want to focus during this transition are:

1. json/yaml manipulation
2. http requests
3. string/file manipulation
4. gluing services together (this is more complex than it sounds)
5. debugging
6. web servers

But, the fact that I’m surprised by the size of the Nim binaries + its speed is something that I blame Python for :P
