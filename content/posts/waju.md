Waju or whatever is called is a game that until this day I don't know from where it comes. But, is fun.

Edit: The game is based on a German game called [Mensch Ã¤rgere Dich nicht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht)

## Goal

The goal of the game is very simple:

1. Move your marbles for **one lap** from your home to your goal.
2. Don't worry about winning but don't let anyone else win.
3. Have fun.

## Board

The board has six main components:

### Dice

> Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.  --Ralph Waldo Emerson

### Home

This is the waiting point and one of the most infuriating places you can be in the game, it's also the place where you start.

### Start

The starting point of your home is always located in the first spot to the right of your home.

In the picture above is the spot that has the same colour as the home or marbles in this case.

### Road

This is where the battle happens.

### Void

I've seen people staying here for months!!

The void is a shortcut you can take only from **your** starting point or **your** corner and only if you roll a `5` or `1` respectively.

Once in the void, you can only move back to the road by rolling a `1` and only a `1` to **your** corner to the right.

## Rules

* Play the game with two dice.
* Put up to 4 marbles in your home.
* Each turn you roll two dice, and you get two movements
  * For each die:
      * If you roll `1` or `6`, you roll again. And repeat as many times as you roll `1` or `6`.
      * Only reroll after you finish your available movements.
* You can spend a movement to take to the road a marble by rolling a `1` or `6` with any of your dice.
  * If you don't have any marble on the road and you don't roll a `1` or `6` your turn pass.
* You can choose to spend the die in only the following ways:
  * Combine both dice and spend them in one marble.
      * For instance, use the sum of two dice to move one marble forward.
  * Spend one die in one marble and the second one in another marble.
      * For instance, spend one movement to take a marble out of your home and the second one to move forward **another** marble.
  * You **cannot** chose to spend two dice on the same marble in two movements on the same roll.
      * If you reroll due to a `1` or `6` you can choose to move _that_ marble again
  * Taking out a marble from your home spends a movement and you **cannot* move that marble again until your next turn or a reroll.
    * If you don't have any other marble to move, you can spend two separate movements in one marble.
* You **cannot** chose to spend only one die per roll.
  * Only if you reroll one die due to `1` or `6`.
* You can **only** move your marbles forward clockwise.
* You **cannot** jump or stay in the same spot as one of your marbles.
* If you put one of your marbles on the same spot as one of the other players, the other player's marble **must** go to their respective home.
  * _Enjoy the feeling_ :)
* Bouncing back is possible, but **must** be your last choice
  * Happens when the **only** option is to move the marble that will bounce.
    * For instance, you **should** spend a movement to take a marble from home (if you have) to the road instead of bouncing.
* For each marble you have, move them forward on the road for one lap and place them in your goal spots.
  * Other players **cannot** put their marbles on your goal spots.
      * _are you safe?_
* You **win** if you put all your marbles on your goal.
