I'm currently building `mooomooo`, driven by my personal frustration with disconnected and manual work that I have to do in JIRA. My vision is to unify software lifecycle management, daily operations, and issue tracking into a single cohesive system that genuinely reflects the current state of an organization. By doing so, `mooomooo` aims to eliminate tedious manual synchronization and keep teams effortlessly aligned.

Many developers and project managers have shared with me (and online!!) the pain of using tools like Jira, GitHub Issues, Asana, Linear, or Monday and even Sentry. These tools often force separate workflows for development, operations, issue tracking, and project management. Teams spend too much time keeping things synchronized manually or through brittle automation scripts. Often, people simply stop updating these systems properly, causing dashboards to drift further from reality. `mooomooo` exists precisely to eliminate this problem by creating a unified, shared source of truth.

At the core of `mooomooo` is the fundamental idea that everything is data. Strategic goals, epics, tasks, code commits, deployments, operational feedback, and even failures are stored together in a single unified model. When something changes, every view, report, or interface immediately reflects that change. This removes redundant manual steps and prevents outdated information from lingering across different tools.

`mooomooo` is designed for flexibility. Teams begin with sensible defaults to get started quickly, but as they evolve, their workflows can adapt seamlessly. Whether your team breaks goals into epics and tasks, prefers sprints, continuous delivery, or Kanban, or interacts via a UI, CLI, editor, or automation script. `mooomooo` supports all of these naturally. It adapts to how your team actually works rather than forcing rigid processes.

Developers benefit significantly because much of the tedious manual work disappears. Instead of logging into multiple platforms to update tickets, move cards, or report statuses manually, `mooomooo` automates these processes. Deployment errors, logs, and troubleshooting steps feed automatically into the same data model. Developers instantly receive relevant context, historical insights, and helpful suggestions directly integrated with their preferred tools, editors, or scripts. This greatly reduces context switching and frustration.

Security is foundational in `mooomooo`, built on a zero trust model from the ground up. Users and automated agents gain access only to the data and operations explicitly required. Every access is clearly defined, minimal, and continuously logged. This careful control reduces risk, makes data sharing safe, and increases transparency and trust within teams and across the organization.

`mooomooo` aims to become the definitive platform where your organization's true state lives. It's a place where strategy, operations, incidents, project tasks, and feedback coexist transparently within one accurate data layer. With `mooomooo`, teams spend less time managing disconnected tools and more time solving real problems.
