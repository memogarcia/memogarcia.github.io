I've been thinking a lot about how we interact with technology, and I've come to realize that being familiar with something doesn't always mean it's simple. In fact, it can sometimes make things more complicated.

For example, when I'm working on code or documentation, I find myself getting too close to the issue. It's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture and get caught up in the details. That's why it's important for us to take a step back, look at our work from a different perspective, and ask for feedback.

By doing so, we can ensure that our intended outcome matches reality, and that our solutions are effective and easy to use.
