## How to connect rooms between buildings

In our building analogy, the internet is like a city that connects different buildings and their networks. It is a vast network of interconnected networks that allows people and devices to communicate with each other from anywhere in the world.

Just like a city has roads, highways, and other transportation systems that allow people to move from one place to another, the internet has cables, satellites, and other infrastructure that allow data to move from one network to another.

At the heart of the internet are routers, which are like traffic lights and road signs that direct data traffic between different networks. Routers use a variety of protocols to determine the best path for data to take between networks.

In the same way that a person can travel from one city to another by car, plane, or train, data can travel between networks using different protocols, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP. These protocols enable different types of communication, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.

Just as a city has different neighborhoods with different cultures and languages, the internet has different regions with different languages and protocols. For example, some networks in Asia may use different protocols and standards than networks in Europe or North America.

Overall, the internet is like a vast, interconnected city that allows people and devices to communicate with each other across great distances. And just as a city is always evolving and changing, the internet is constantly growing and adapting to meet the needs of its users.
