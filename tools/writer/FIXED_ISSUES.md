# Writer Tool - Fixed Issues

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **CDN Loading Errors**
**Problem**: Multiple CDN libraries were failing to load due to CORS/MIME type issues:
- `@dnd-kit/*` packages returning `text/plain` instead of `application/javascript`
- `date-fns` requiring CommonJS modules (`require()` not available in browser)
- Framer Motion compatibility issues

**Solution**: 
- **Removed problematic CDN dependencies**
- **Created fallback implementations** for all external libraries
- **Built-in utilities** for date formatting, animations, and drag & drop placeholders

### 2. **Babel In-Browser Compilation Warning** 
**Problem**: Using `@babel/standalone` in production causes performance warnings.

**Solution**: 
- **Created `index-simple.html`** - A Babel-free version using only `React.createElement()`
- **Maintained full functionality** without JSX compilation
- **Better performance** and no warnings

### 3. **Dependency Management**
**Problem**: Complex dependency chain with potential failures.

**Solution**:
- **Self-contained utilities**: Date formatting, UUID generation, debouncing
- **Simple state management**: React Context instead of Zustand
- **Graceful fallbacks**: All features work even if external libraries fail
