# Performance Optimizations for Planner Tool

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to achieve smooth 60fps dragging and scrolling in the planner tool.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. CSS Performance Enhancements

#### GPU Acceleration
- Added `will-change: transform` to draggable elements (.task, .epic, .north-star)
- Used `transform3d()` instead of `transform()` for GPU acceleration  
- Added `backface-visibility: hidden` for optimized 3D transforms
- Force GPU layers with `transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0)`

#### Transition Management
- Disabled transitions during drag operations (`transition: none !important` on `.dragging`)
- Added `pointer-events: none` during drag to optimize hit testing
- Optimized hover states to only apply when not dragging

#### Performance Classes
- `.high-performance-drag` - Applied during drag operations
- `.gpu-accelerated` - For GPU-optimized elements
- `.performance-mode` - Global performance mode
- `.canvas-optimized` - Optimized canvas interactions

### 2. JavaScript Performance Optimizations

#### RequestAnimationFrame (RAF) System
- Implemented RAF-based animation loop for smooth 60fps updates
- Batched DOM updates to minimize reflows
- Scheduled updates instead of immediate renders
- Frame-rate monitoring and performance metrics

#### Event Handler Optimizations
- Throttled mouse move events to ~60fps (16ms intervals)
- Throttled wheel events to ~100fps (10ms intervals)
- Used passive event listeners where appropriate
- Optimized touch event handling for mobile

#### Movement Function Optimizations
- Created optimized versions: `moveTaskOptimized()`, `moveEpicOptimized()`, etc.
- Used `transform3d()` for all position updates
- Batched DOM updates with `batchDOMUpdates()`
- Scheduled connection updates instead of immediate renders

#### Memory and Performance Management
- Pending position updates map to batch changes
- Performance metrics tracking (FPS, frame time, render time)
- Automatic cleanup of performance classes after drag operations

### 3. Touch Event Optimizations

#### Mobile Performance
- Unified touch and mouse event handling
- Prevented default scrolling during drag operations  
- Optimized touch event listeners with appropriate passive flags
- Added touch-specific performance classes

### 4. SVG and Connection Optimizations

#### Rendering Optimization
- Added `shape-rendering: optimizeSpeed` for SVG elements
- GPU acceleration for connections SVG
- Scheduled connection updates instead of immediate renders
- Optimized connection re-rendering frequency

### 5. Performance Monitoring

#### Real-time Monitoring
- Built-in performance monitor (`performance-monitor.js`)
- FPS tracking and display
- Frame time and render time metrics
- Drag event counting
- Console commands for easy toggling

## How to Use Performance Monitoring

### Enable Performance Monitor
```javascript
// In browser console
PerformanceMonitor.enable()
```

### Disable Performance Monitor  
```javascript
// In browser console
PerformanceMonitor.disable()
```

### Monitor Display
The performance monitor shows:
- **FPS**: Current frames per second (green: 50+, yellow: 30-49, red: <30)
- **Frame**: Frame time in milliseconds
- **Render**: Render operation time
- **Drags**: Number of drag events processed

## Technical Implementation Details

### RAF Animation Loop
```javascript
animationLoop(currentTime) {
    if (!this.isAnimating) return;
    
    // Throttle to target FPS
    if (currentTime - this.lastFrameTime >= this.frameInterval) {
        this.processFrameUpdates();
        this.updatePerformanceMetrics(currentTime);
        this.lastFrameTime = currentTime;
    }
    
    if (this.isAnimating) {
        this.animationFrame = requestAnimationFrame(this.animationLoop.bind(this));
    }
}
```

### Optimized Transform Application
```javascript
applyTransform3d(element, x, y, scale = 1) {
    if (!element || !element.style) return;
    element.style.transform = `translate3d(${x}px, ${y}px, 0) scale(${scale})`;
}
```

### Throttled Event Handling
```javascript
handleCanvasMouseMove(e) {
    if (!this.dragging) return;
    
    // Throttle mouse move events for smooth 60fps performance
    const currentTime = Date.now();
    if (currentTime - this.lastMouseMoveTime < this.mouseMoveThrottleMs) {
        return;
    }
    this.lastMouseMoveTime = currentTime;
    
    // ... rest of handler
}
```

## Performance Benefits

### Expected Results
- **Smooth 60fps** dragging and scrolling
- **Reduced jank** during intensive operations
- **Better mobile performance** with optimized touch handling
- **Lower CPU usage** through GPU acceleration
- **Responsive interactions** even with many elements

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS transforms support
- Hardware acceleration available
- Touch events for mobile devices
- RequestAnimationFrame support

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Performance Metrics
The system tracks:
- Frame rate (target: 60fps)
- Frame time (target: <16.67ms)
- Render time for operations
- Event processing frequency

### Debug Information
- Console warnings when FPS drops below 50
- Performance class applications visible in DevTools
- RAF animation loop status
- Event throttling effectiveness

## Future Optimizations

### Potential Improvements
1. **Virtual Rendering** for large numbers of items (1000+)
2. **Web Workers** for complex calculations
3. **Canvas-based rendering** for extreme performance
4. **Intersection Observer** for visibility-based optimizations
5. **OffscreenCanvas** for background rendering

### Performance Targets
- Maintain 60fps with 100+ items
- Sub-16ms frame times during drag operations  
- Smooth interactions on mobile devices
- Efficient memory usage and cleanup
