# Writer - Structured Writing Tool

A client-side structured writing application with project management, 3-column layout, and clipboard functionality.

## Structure

```
writer/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ test.html          # Development testing page
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css          # Cyberpunk-themed CSS
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx            # Root React application component
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # This file
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ThemeToggle.jsx     # Dark/light theme switcher
    â”œâ”€â”€ WriteStore.jsx      # State management (React Context + useReducer)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Header.jsx          # Top navigation and project controls
    â”œâ”€â”€ Sidebar.jsx         # Project list and statistics
    â”œâ”€â”€ MainEditor.jsx      # Primary text editing area
    â”œâ”€â”€ ClipboardPanel.jsx  # Clipboard management
    â””â”€â”€ WriterApp.jsx       # Main app component wrapper
```

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework (loaded via CDN)
- **React Context + useReducer** - State management
- **localStorage** - Client-side data persistence
- **Babel Standalone** - JSX transpilation in browser
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Theming system

## Features

### Current (v1.0)
- âœ… Project management (create, rename, delete)
- âœ… Auto-save functionality
- âœ… Dark/light theme toggle
- âœ… Clipboard system for text snippets
- âœ… Word/character counting
- âœ… Responsive 3-column layout
- âœ… localStorage persistence
- âœ… Search clipboard functionality

### Future Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ Drag & drop (will use @dnd-kit)
- ðŸ”„ Rich text editing features
- ðŸ”„ Export functionality (JSON, Markdown, HTML)
- ðŸ”„ Collaborative features
- ðŸ”„ Plugin system
- ðŸ”„ Advanced search and filtering

## Development

### Testing
Open `test.html` in a browser to:
- Verify React dependencies load correctly
- Test localStorage functionality
- Check basic app functionality
- Access the main app

### Adding New Features
1. Create component in `components/` directory
2. Export component to `window` object for global access
3. Import in `index.html` with `<script type="text/babel" src="..."></script>`
4. Use component in parent components

### State Management
The app uses React Context with useReducer for state management:

```javascript
const { 
  projects,           // Map of project objects
  activeProjectId,    // Currently selected project
  clipboard,          // Array of clipboard items
  theme              // Current theme ('light' | 'dark')
} = useWriter();
```

### Storage Format
Data is stored in localStorage as JSON:

```javascript
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "projects": [["id", projectObject], ...],
  "activeProjectId": "string",
  "clipboard": [clipboardItem, ...],
  "theme": "light|dark",
  "lastModified": "ISO string"
}
```

### CSS Architecture
- CSS Custom Properties for theming
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Dark/light mode support
- Component-based organization

## Migration Notes

This app was migrated from a Next.js SSR application to a pure client-side app:
- PostgreSQL â†’ localStorage
- Server-side rendering â†’ Client-side React
- Complex build process â†’ Simple HTML + CDN
- Zustand â†’ React Context (for simplicity)

The architecture maintains the original 3-column layout and core functionality while simplifying the deployment and development process.
