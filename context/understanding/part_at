 A Tier 2 ISP might be more like a regional road company – they have highways within a certain region and connect to some Tier 1s for broader reach. They may peer with others in adjacent regions, but often they still pay upstream for some destinations. They serve as a middleman: they might serve smaller ISPs (Tier 3s) and enterprise customers, and they buy bulk transit from Tier 1s.

 A Tier 3 ISP is usually a local road provider – think city roads or last-mile streets. They directly serve end-users and small businesses. They almost always pay a larger ISP to reach the wider internet (transit), unless they’re in a metro area where they can peer at an exchange for some local traffic.

In practical terms:

 Tier 1: e.g., companies like CenturyLink (Level3), AT&T, Verizon (certain parts), NTT, Telia, Deutsche Telekom, etc. They have global networks.

 Tier 2: might be like a national ISP that still buys some international transit or a big cable provider that peers regionally but buys from Tier1 for overseas.

 Tier 3: local cable company or small fiber ISP that only operates in a city or county and purchases internet transit from a Tier1 or Tier2.

Roles also differ:

 Some ISPs focus on consumer access (like Comcast, Charter, etc. which are Tier 2 or Tier 3 in hierarchy but giant in subscriber count).

 Others are more about backbone and wholesale (like Level3 historically had no retail customers, just carried traffic for others).

 There are also specialized ISPs for, say, businesses (dedicated leased lines, etc.), or for mobile (cellular data providers, though nowadays they are just telcos doing all).

Why does this matter? Because it explains how data flows financially and technically:

 When you pay your local ISP (Tier3) for internet, part of that money goes to them maintaining local lines, and part may go to paying their upstream Tier2 for carrying data to the rest of the world.

 That Tier2 in turn might pay a Tier1 for any traffic it can’t route via peering.

 Tier1’s settle among themselves usually without money, but they invest in huge infrastructure. They recoup costs by charging Tier2’s and large customers.

In our analogy city:

 Tier1s built the main freeways (and maybe share costs with others at national borders).

 Tier2s built the state highways and sometimes tolled them to cover the cost of paying to use the main freeways.

 Tier3s built the city streets and connect to highways with on-ramps that might have a tollbooth (the cost of handing to Tier2).

Now, also think of roles:

 Local ISP (Tier 3): brings connectivity to your building’s doorstep (the last mile).

 Regional ISP (Tier 2): runs networks across a larger area (maybe a whole country or large state), linking many local networks.

 Backbone ISP (Tier 1): connects countries and major regions, basically ensuring that no matter how far apart two networks are, there’s a path through the backbone.

The ultimate effect: any building can talk to any other because Tier3 passes to Tier2 passes to Tier1 (if needed, then back down to Tier2 and Tier3 on the other side). A city-to-city-to-city chain.

For everyday users, you don’t need to worry about tiers, but if you run a company that needs ultra-reliable connectivity, you might multi-home (connect to multiple ISPs maybe one Tier1 and one Tier2) to have redundancy.

On humor: you can imagine Tier1 as the “internet giants” – their engineers like to brag they operate the backbone of the internet. Tier3 techs brag about getting fiber to someone’s farm out in the countryside. Both are noble tasks.

In essence, each tier has its scope and responsibility:

 Tier1: ensure the core is strong and international traffic flows.

 Tier2: ensure regional connectivity and interface between core and access.

 Tier3: ensure end-users get on the net.

Technical Perspective:

 The tier system is somewhat informal; some say it’s outdated because even content networks bypass hierarchy by directly connecting to access ISPs (flattening).

 But historically, Tier1 means no transit dependence. Tier2: has transit, but also significant peering. Tier3: mostly transit.

 Example: A small ISP in a rural area might buy transit from a bigger national ISP (Tier2). It might also connect at an exchange in a nearby city to exchange traffic with other local ISPs (so local traffic doesn’t go all the way out then back).

 A content provider might not be “ISP” in the traditional sense, but they build a network akin to one. Google is effectively its own Tier1 now because it peers globally and has its own cables. Same with Microsoft, etc.

 Some mobile providers piggyback on others (MVNOs like virtual networks), but that’s another layer (like an ISP renting from another).

 For nerds: sometimes Tier1 networks have public lists, but they occasionally change (mergers, etc.). The business relationships (peering vs transit) decide classification.

 Tier1 often means if two Tier1s break their peering, parts of the internet could partition (because each are big enough that without direct or indirect link, some routes won’t be known). That’s why Tier1’s maintain an all-peer group.

 Roles: Sometimes an ISP may wear multiple hats (e.g., AT&T has Tier1 global backbone and also Tier3 last mile to customers).

 The concept of “last mile” vs “middle mile” vs “backbone” is similar segmentation.

So in summary, ISP tiers and roles reflect the structure of how the internet is built like layers: local distribution, regional aggregation, global core. It’s like how roads go local streets -> county roads -> interstates. Without each layer, connectivity would break down.

Alright, now given all this connectivity, what’s the outcome for us? Global communication – our next short affirmation that indeed, thanks to all this, you can reach anywhere.
Global Communication

Ultimately, because of the collaborations and infrastructures set by ISPs (and the underlying technologies), we achieve something quite magical: any building (network) can talk to any other building in the world, essentially in real-time
. This is global communication at work.

This chapter is a bit of a capstone of Part 2, emphasizing that from your little room, you can reach across the globe:

 From a tiny village’s network in one country, you can stream video from a server in a mega data center on another continent.

 A student in their dorm (one room in one building) can video chat with another student thousands of miles away as if they were next door.

 Businesses can connect their offices worldwide through secure tunnels (VPNs, which we’ll discuss in security part) – making it feel like one cohesive network even if physically distributed.

All the pieces we discussed – IP addresses, DNS, routers, gateways, ports, protocols, ISPs, etc. – are the unsung heroes enabling this.

To put it into the building terms: you, in Room 101 of Building A in City X, can send a message that ends up in Room 202 of Building B in City Y halfway around the planet. And not just you – millions can do similar simultaneously, thanks to the scalability of the system.

Think of historical context: It’s as if every person in every building got a magic telephone line connecting them to anyone else – except it’s even more versatile than a telephone because it’s data of all kinds (text, voice, video, interactive apps).

The internet city truly turned the world into a “global village” concept – because distance and location matter a lot less now for communication:

 Yes, there is still latency (it’s not instant-instant if far, maybe 100-300ms), but that’s tiny.

 People collaborate in real time from different countries on documents, code, etc. because the network allows their computers to behave like they’re in neighboring cubicles.

We should also note: all this happens at incredible speed and reliability. The fact that one can reload a webpage from servers across the world and see it in seconds, or that we can watch a live sports event happening in another country with only a few seconds delay – these are everyday miracles courtesy of computer networks.

This chapter might also be a good place to reflect on how interconnected everything is:

 The phrase “the world is connected like never before” is directly enabled by what we covered.

 However, it also means if major networks go down, it can have wide impact (like if a Tier1 has an outage, many dependent networks could feel it).

So global communication via the internet is a bit like having built an extremely complex yet robust “worldwide web” of roads and protocols that ties humanity together (for better or worse – but mostly better, we hope, in terms of sharing knowledge and connectivity).

Essentially, from your room to the world:

 IP + port: find the right building and room.

 DNS: translate human-friendly names to those addresses.

 Protocols: speak in a way the other side understands.

 Routers/gateways: carry you through the city intersections to the destination.

 Public/private IP & NAT: handle addressing at the boundaries.

 ISPs: provide the pathways and global reach.

 If needed, specialized tweaks (like VPNs or CDNs or quality of service) can optimize or secure specific communications – topics we are going to delve into next (security and advanced stuff in Part 3 maybe).

But at its core, the motto could be: no matter where you are, if you’re on the network, you can reach anywhere else on the network. That’s the definition of the internet: interconnected networks forming one big global network.

It’s something to appreciate – we often only notice internet infrastructure when it fails or is slow, but when you stop and think, it’s astonishing that it works as well as it does.
Technical Perspective:

 Achieving global reach requires adherence to standards (so any IP network can interface with another) and cooperation among operators. Organizations like the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) ensure new technologies remain interoperable and backward-compatible as much as possible.

 There are slight exceptions: some regions might have restricted internet (firewalls like the Great Firewall of China, or isolated intranets), but physically even those can connect – the isolation is a policy choice, not a technical necessity.

 Even beyond Earth: the networks extend to satellites, space stations. One day, maybe interplanetary networks (delay-tolerant networking is being researched for that).

 Key stat: ~5 billion people use the internet, tens of billions of devices. The scale is global indeed. Data flows between all continents at terabit speeds routinely.

 Modern enterprise networks often connect via internet-based VPNs rather than leased lines, because internet is so pervasive and high-bandwidth now.

 But for everyday personal usage, it’s things like email, social media, video calls that really highlight the “wow, I’m talking to someone 10,000 km away like they’re here.”

 The backbone upgrades like undersea cables capable of petabits, etc., ensure the capacity for global comm grows with demand (like 4K streaming, etc. that would’ve been unthinkable to send globally a couple decades ago).

 The internet weather: There are tools to see global internet health (like monitors of BGP routes, etc.). Sometimes a country gets cut off (cable cut to an island nation, etc.) – then you realize global communication isn’t guaranteed, it’s maintained by ongoing efforts to have multiple redundant links.

Thus, the dream of networking – connecting disparate systems – has been realized to the point where location is almost irrelevant to data. That is a massive achievement of computer networks by analogy or otherwise.

Now, let’s move to Part 3 – tackling more conceptual or future stuff (security, advanced networking, cloud, etc.), continuing our analogy narrative.

(Moving into Part 3: Hotels in the Cloud & Future Cities)
Network Security

Now that we have our massive interconnected city, not everyone roaming the streets has good intentions. Just as in a real city you’d have locks on your doors, security guards in important buildings, and police at checkpoints, in networks we need security measures to protect data and systems

Let’s translate some common network security elements into our analogy:

 Firewall: Imagine a gated community or a building security desk that checks IDs. A firewall is like a gate or guard at the entrance of your network/building, scrutinizing every incoming or outgoing packet (visitor). It has a set of rules deciding who’s allowed in or out. For example, if someone from outside (internet) tries to access a sensitive room that’s supposed to be private, the firewall can block that attempt – like a guard saying “You’re not on the guest list, you can’t go to Floor 5.” It essentially permits only traffic that is known to be safe or expected, and blocks everything else by default (or according to policy)

 Encryption: This is like sending letters in sealed, tamper-proof envelopes that only the recipient can open. If two rooms are sending secret messages, they don’t want anyone in the middle (even if they break into the mail truck) to read them. In networking, encryption (like using HTTPS, VPNs, etc.) ensures that even if data packets are intercepted on route, they look like gibberish to eavesdroppers. Only the intended parties, who have the keys (like the secret combination to open the envelope), can decrypt and understand the contents. It’s akin to using a language only you and your friend know, so even if someone grabs the letter, it’s meaningless to them.

 Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS): These are like alarm systems or security cameras within the building. They monitor activity and can alert or respond if something suspicious happens. For instance, if someone manages to get inside and is prowling through hallways at odd hours rattling door knobs, an IDS would notice that unusual pattern and raise an alarm (in network terms, maybe detecting a port scan or a brute-force login attempt). An IPS might go further and automatically lock certain doors (block traffic from that source) to stop the intruder.

 Segmentation: Sometimes even within a building, you don’t want free movement everywhere. You might have locked floors or sections (like only authorized personnel can go to the server room). In networks, segmentation means dividing the network into zones (maybe using VLANs or subnets with firewalls between them) so that a breach in one part doesn’t automatically grant access to everything. It’s like having an internal locked door – even if someone got into the lobby, they can’t reach the executive offices without another key.

 Authentication and Access Control: This is basically checking credentials at various points. Passwords, two-factor, etc., are like keys or badges. Only the right keycard opens the server rack or the Wi-Fi access point. In networking, when you log in to a system or connect to Wi-Fi, you prove your identity and only then you’re allowed certain network privileges.

 Security updates (patching): If a vulnerability is found (like a weak lock on a door), you need to fix it (change the lock) before burglars exploit it. Similarly, network devices and software need regular updates to fix security holes. That ties into maintenance – but from a security perspective, it’s critical because attackers constantly look for outdated “locks” they can pick.

Network security aims to prevent break-ins, theft, and damage to your data or systems
. In a city, that might mean preventing burglars, vandals, or spies. On the internet, threats include hackers stealing data, malware destroying files, or unauthorized users misusing resources.

One common scenario: the firewall at your home router likely blocks all “unsolicited” incoming connections from the internet. That’s why, for example, someone across the world can’t just directly access your PC unless you initiated something or explicitly allowed it. It’s like your home network behind a firewall is a gated estate – you can go out to the internet (outbound connections usually allowed, analogous to residents leaving freely), but the outside world can’t walk in without permission.

Encryption (like using VPNs or HTTPS) ensures privacy – think of it as drawing the curtains and speaking in code so even if someone is snooping around outside, they can’t figure out what you’re doing.

Without these security measures:

 Data could be intercepted (like someone reading all your mail or listening at your door).

 Attackers could enter your network and cause chaos (like thieves entering and rummaging rooms).

 Sensitive systems could be sabotaged.

So, network security is essentially building trustworthy walls, locks, and guards in our networked city to keep the bad actors at bay and sensitive info safe.
Technical Perspective:

 Firewall types: There are network firewalls (filtering IP/port/protocols based on rules) and application firewalls (deep packet inspection, etc.). They can be hardware or software. E.g., an enterprise might have a firewall that only allows web traffic (ports 80/443) to its web server and blocks everything else.

 Stateful firewall: Most modern ones track connections (so they allow reply traffic for a request that went out, but not new unsolicited ones in).

 NAT as firewall: Many home setups rely on NAT (since your router holds the public IP and your PCs are in private space) which inherently blocks incoming (because no mapping exists until you initiate one). This is a side-benefit of NAT (security by obscurity).

 Encryption: Protocols like TLS (for HTTPS, etc.), IPsec (for VPNs), SSL, etc. They use cryptographic keys. For example, when you see the padlock in your browser, an TLS handshake ensured the traffic is encrypted between your device and that website’s server. Even your ISP or any sniffers on the way can’t see the actual content (they just see gibberish and maybe the domain name depending on the protocol version).

 VPN (Virtual Private Network): It creates an encrypted “tunnel” between two networks or a user and network. It’s like having a secret passage connecting two buildings directly, bypassing the public roads and with nobody else able to look inside the tunnel. We have a dedicated chapter for VPN analogies next, but mention here contextually: it’s a key security tool.

 IDS/IPS: These often use known signatures of attacks (like antivirus for network traffic) or anomaly detection. An IDS might alert human admins, an IPS might auto-drop packets that match a known attack signature. They are the sensors and automated responders.

 Segmentation: Often done via VLANs, subnets, and internal firewalls or ACLs. E.g., corporate network might separate guest Wi-Fi from internal network so a guest (or an attacker in guest network) can’t reach internal file servers.

 Zero trust architecture: Newer approach where no one is trusted by default even inside the network – every access is authenticated and verified. It’s like even inside the building, you still need to badge through every door because who knows if someone tailgated in.

 Physical security: Not to forget, securing the physical network (locks on server rooms, surveillance in data centers) supports the cyber security – someone with physical access could do a lot (like plug in rogue devices).

 Common attacks to defend against: DDoS (overwhelm network – mitigated by special DDoS protection services which are like having extra large gates to handle riots), man-in-the-middle (eavesdropping – mitigated by encryption), phishing (tricking users to give access – mitigated by training and filters), malware (mitigated by security software and network scanning), etc.

In short, network security is a vast field, but the analogy of securing a building or city maps pretty well to the fundamental ideas: define perimeters, control entry/exit, watch for intrusions, compartmentalize to limit damage, and keep communications confidential and tamper-proof.

So, with our networks secure, let’s move on to a specific security technique that also uses analogy nicely: VPNs.
VPNs as Tunnels

Imagine you have two buildings in different parts of a city, and you want a secure, private pathway between them that nobody else can use or even see into. One way: build an underground tunnel connecting them. On the surface, to everyone else, it’s invisible; people outside can’t easily access it or eavesdrop on what goes through it. That’s exactly the idea of a VPN (Virtual Private Network)

In networking, a VPN is like a secret tunnel through the public internet:

 It connects two networks (or a user and a network) over the internet, but in a way that the data is encrypted and encapsulated, so outsiders just see some encrypted packets, not the actual content or the internal addresses.

 It’s called “virtual” because the tunnel is not a physical new cable, it’s virtual – created by software. But functionally, it’s as if you laid a private cable.

For example, say you’re working remotely from home but need to access your office network’s internal resources (which are normally restricted to on-premises). Your company might have you use a VPN. When you connect, your computer basically enters a virtual tunnel to the office:
- Your PC gets an IP address as if it were a local machine in the office, through the VPN.
- All data between your PC and the office network goes encrypted through the internet to the office’s VPN server, which then decrypts it and forwards it inside.
- Anyone intercepting the traffic in between just sees gibberish going to the office’s VPN server. They can’t tell what you’re accessing or even necessarily that you’re accessing internal addresses.

In analogy terms:

 Building A (your home) and Building B (your office) set up a special elevator or tunnel that goes underneath the city directly connecting them. You, from Room 101 in Building A, can go into this secure elevator and pop out in Building B’s basement, then roam Building B as if you were local. Meanwhile, people in the city just see you enter a door in Building A and later appear in Building B, but they couldn't observe your path between or intercept you – you bypassed the streets.

 Outsiders only see that Building A and B have some connection, but they can’t get into it. It's as if the tunnel is hidden or at least sealed off – you’d need keys at both ends to use it.

VPNs are heavily used for:

 Secure remote access: as described, employees connecting to corporate networks, without exposing those networks to the whole internet.

 Connecting multiple sites: say a company has offices in different cities. They could lease dedicated lines (expensive), or simply use VPN tunnels over the internet to link their networks so they act as one. It’s like those offices get a protected corridor connecting them, courtesy of the internet but shielded from others.

 Privacy for users: Some individuals use VPN services to encrypt their data when on untrusted networks (like using a VPN at a café to prevent others on the Wi-Fi from sniffing your traffic). It also masks your IP to the outside – all your traffic emerges from the VPN server, so to external websites, it looks like you’re coming from there, not from your actual location. That’s like entering the tunnel in one city and coming out in another city – to someone outside, you effectively teleported location.

The phrase from our source, “Outsiders see only the regular streets, but you and your partner building use a hidden corridor”
, nails it. This hidden corridor (VPN tunnel) ensures privacy and exclusivity.
