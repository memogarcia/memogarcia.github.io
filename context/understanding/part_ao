One can think of Tier 1 ISPs as the “backbone of the internet” – e.g., companies like AT&T, Sprint, Level 3 (Lumen), NTT, Telia, Deutsche Telekom, etc., which have massive international networks.

Tier 2 might be national ISPs or large regionals – e.g., Comcast (though Comcast might be almost Tier1 now), or smaller country-level carriers that still rely on Tier1 for some international routes.

Tier 3 are the local guys like city cable providers or small telephone companies offering DSL.

Roles also involve customer focus:

 Tier 3: focus on end-customer, last-mile tech, support, etc.

 Tier 2: focus on broad coverage, connecting many places, often selling to Tier 3s or large businesses, sometimes also direct to consumers in their area.

 Tier 1: focus on high-capacity trunk lines, selling transit to Tier2 or big content providers, not dealing with individual consumers typically.

To tie analogy:

 Tier 1 ISP = **“massive highway developers”*
 – they ensure the major routes exist.

 Tier 2 = regional connectors – building the smaller highways and roads off the main backbone.

 Tier 3 = local street builders – connecting individual buildings to the road system.

Understanding tiers helps understand how data flows and how ISPs interrelate:

 Tier 3 and Tier 2 often have to pay Tier 1 for the traffic that goes beyond their network.

 Many Tier 2’s try to reduce that by peering at IXPs (so some traffic to other Tier 2’s can bypass Tier1).

 Tier 1’s form the core so they typically only exchange traffic as peers (if a Tier1 had to pay another, then by definition it’s not Tier1 because it’s not reachable everywhere solely via peers).

 There’s also concept of content vs access networks: e.g., some large networks like Google or Netflix are technically Tier 2 (they still buy some transit maybe) but they have so much presence and peering that they act almost like Tier1 for delivering their content.

The fact the internet is built by multiple tiers ensures scalability:
No one company had to wire every home; smaller ISPs did that and then plugged into bigger ones, and bigger ones interconnect. It’s like modular growth.
Technical Perspective:

 Tier 1: by definition, an ISP that can reach every other network solely via settlement-free peering (no transit costs). There’s maybe a dozen or so global Tier1’s. They exchange massive routes (they basically carry default-free BGP tables).

 Tier 2: typically will have a mix of peering and transit. They might be default-free (having BGP routes to everywhere via peers and providers) but they pay for some routes. They often provide connectivity to Tier 3s.

 Tier 3: likely doesn’t peer widely, just buys one or two upstream transits. Might only have default routes (point everything to upstream).

 BGP route advertisement often reflects this: Tier 1’s advertise everywhere, Tier 2’s might only advertise to their peers and upstream their own and customer routes (and get full routes from upstream).

 Roles:

 Tier 1 sells transit to Tier 2 and big content; peers with Tier1s.

 Tier 2 sells to Tier 3 and businesses; peers where beneficial; buys transit from Tier1 for rest.

 Tier 3 sells to consumers; buys transit from Tier2 or Tier1.

It’s like a pyramid:

 Tier1 at top (few, global).

 Tier2 in middle (more, regional/national).

 Tier3 at bottom (many, local).

 And traffic flows up/down the pyramid as needed.

But note, big content networks (not “access” ISPs since they serve content not consumers) have kind of inverted flow: they often pay or build their own tier-like networks to distribute content to Tier3s (like Netflix contracts with Tier3s to host caches or with Tier2 to peer directly, etc., to avoid paying Tier1 transit for their high volume).

However, to keep analogies consistent:
They show Tier1 as “massive highway developers”, Tier2 as “large highway developers connecting local roads”, Tier3 as local last-mile.
We can just mirror that.

So, the internet is loosely hierarchical:

 You as a consumer likely connect to a Tier3 (maybe directly to a Tier2 if it’s a larger ISP).

 That Tier3 connects to one or more Tier2 or Tier1 for full internet.

 Tier2 might connect to Tier1 or sometimes multiple Tier1’s plus peers.

 Tier1’s connect among themselves and cover everything.

This ensures robust global communication where smaller players don’t have to individually connect to every network – they use the tiered structure.

So tier roles in analogy helps illustrate how different companies cooperate to form the internet:

 Without Tier1’s highways, we’d have fragmented networks.

 Without Tier2’s, Tier1’s would have to connect to every small ISP (impractical).

 Without Tier3’s, end-users wouldn’t have physical connectivity.
 Each layer is necessary.

Next might talk global comm or summarizing that thanks to ISPs tiers, your building can talk to any other. But we did global network earlier.

Actually, “Global Communication” was listed after ISP Tiers in content, maybe to reaffirm the ultimate result.

But we described global already. It might stress that because of ISPs connecting and tiers, you can truly reach any other building worldwide (we did that in “A Global Network”).

We can mention it to close part 2: basically “ultimately, ISPs of all tiers form the web of roads enabling global communication...”.

We sort of merged that with global network earlier.

We should ensure not to skip content but we've covered it.

Alright, now likely Part 3 covers network security, VPN, load balancing, CDNs, QoS, NAT (we did NAT in part 2 though as NAT was in content list already in part2), but actually NAT was in part2 list and we did it.

Check original TOC part distinctions:

 Part 1: Building foundation (we did up to Data Packets, and Putting it together).

 Part 2: Moving around city (internet city, routers maps, routing tables, traffic & detours, global net, ISPs and all that).

 Possibly end of Part2 with global comm, then Part3: "Hotels in the Clouds & Future Cities" which likely includes:

 Cloud computing analogy (as hotel).

 And possibly network security, VPN (security & future tech).
 Actually cloud stuff was listed as Part 3.
 Network security, VPN, Load balancing, CDN, QoS, NAT, Monitoring, SDN, IPv6, Topologies, Cloud were all listed after Part2 likely.

However, listing shows:
Network Security (32), VPN (33), Load Balancing (34), CDNs (35), QoS (36), NAT (37), Monitoring (38), SDN (39), IPv4 vs IPv6 (40), Topologies (41), Cloud computing as a hotel (42 + subs).

So indeed, those after Tier roles are part of "Part 4: Becoming an Architect" or "Future cities"? Actually, the parts naming is slightly confusing but presumably:
Part3 might cover some advanced/modern topics culminating in Cloud computing (like "hotels in clouds & future cities" suggests cloud and future tech).
Part4: Possibly "Becoming an Architect" focusing on topologies and design (Network Topology was one, which we did at 41 just before cloud).
Actually, sequence says Cloud computing is 42 after topologies.
Maybe:
Part3: Hotels in Clouds & Future Cities (covering Cloud, scalability, etc).
Part4: Becoming an Architect (maybe Topologies and planning? But Topologies we did before Cloud).
Part5: Appendices.

The numbering in TOC is weird around 41 and 42 parts but anyway.

We've done up to Topologies (#41).
So Cloud computing (#42) and subtopics (43-50 about cloud aspects) are next.

We should proceed to Cloud computing analogy as hotel.
Cloud Computing as a Hotel

 Figure: Cloud computing illustrated as a hotel where you rent rooms (computing resources) instead of owning the building. Running your own building (own servers and data center) means handling everything yourself: you pay for the construction, you handle cleaning, repairs, utilities, and security. Now, imagine instead you decide to stay at a hotel – you get a room when you need it, and the hotel staff takes care of the rest (cleaning, fresh towels, building maintenance). Cloud computing works the same way: instead of buying and maintaining your own servers and data center, you rent computing resources (rooms) from a cloud provider’s data center (hotel) and they handle the maintenance and infrastructur

Let’s break down the analogy:

 Owning a building (traditional on-premises IT): You have to buy servers (construction costs), find a place to put them (data center building or server room), supply power and cooling (utilities), set up network connectivity, and hire people to maintain everything (janitors, security guards, repairmen). It’s a lot of upfront cost and ongoing effort. You also have to guess how much capacity you’ll need – build too big and space sits unused, build too small and you run out.

 Staying at a hotel (using cloud computing): You rent servers on-demand from providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. These cloud providers have huge data center “hotels” with thousands of servers (rooms) available. When you need a server (a room), you request it and use it for as long as you need, then “check out” (terminate it) when done. You don’t worry about buying hardware, replacing failed disks, or electrical costs – the provider (hotel staff) handles all that behind the scene

Key benefits in analogy:

 Flexibility (Cloud Flexibility): If you need a bigger space, you can book a bigger room or more rooms easil
 . If hosting an event (a sudden traffic surge or big computation), you can reserve a ballroom (massive resources) temporarily. Cloud providers let you scale up (get more compute/storage) or scale down quickly – analogous to booking more hotel rooms when more guests arrive, and releasing them when they leave. You pay for what you use (no need to own an entire building for a short event).

 No Maintenance Hassles: In a hotel, you don't fix the plumbing or vacuum the floors – hotel staff do. In cloud, the provider manages server maintenance, hardware upgrades, security patching of infrastructure, etc. If a server goes bad, they replace it – you might not even notice because they migrate your instance. You just use the service (the room

 Premium Services: Hotels offer extra amenities (pool, gym, room service). Cloud providers offer higher-level services and managed solutions (like databases, AI services, security tools) – you can opt to use them for extra convenienc
 . Instead of building every service from scratch, you “order from room service” – e.g., use a managed database rather than running your own on a VM.

 Pay-as-You-Go: In a hotel, you pay per night, no long-term mortgage or lease (unless you choose a longer term deal). In cloud, you pay for compute hours or storage per GB-month, etc. There's no large upfront investment – it’s operating expense versus capital expens
 . If you only need a server for an hour, you pay just for that hour.

 Scalability (Cloud Scalability): Got extra guests (increased workload)? The hotel can give you more rooms if available. Cloud similarly can quickly provide more instances or bigger instances when your demand spike
 . When guests leave (load drops), you release the rooms (shut down unneeded instances) and stop paying for them.

 Global Access: Hotels exist in many cities, and if you travel, you can expect similar service. Cloud providers have data centers around the world – you can deploy your applications in any of them, giving global coverage to users with consistent infrastructure. It’s like a hotel chain where each location offers similar services, so you can serve customers from Tokyo or New York by “checking into” a local cloud regio

 Security: Hotels provide locks, safes, and staff for security. Cloud providers invest heavily in security measures (physical security, encryption, backup power) to keep your “room” and data saf
 . Even if something goes wrong (like hardware failure or natural disaster at one data center), they have mechanisms (backups, multi-zone redundancy) to ensure your service stays up (like a hotel having emergency lighting, sprinklers, etc., to keep guests safe).

 Networking (Cloud Networking): In traditional networks, you manage all the wiring and switches. In cloud, connecting services together or to the internet is done virtually – more like the hotel’s internal phone system connecting rooms or providing you internet without you running the cables. Cloud networking gives you many of the capabilities of traditional networks but abstracted (software-defined) so you don't physically wire thing
 . As the analogy says, you can enjoy connectivity (like hotel Wi-Fi) without worrying about how the hotel wired everything.

Essentially, cloud computing is like outsourcing your infrastructure to someone who specializes in it, so you can focus on your core business (just like staying at a hotel lets you focus on your trip or work, not on managing property).

The final line of analogy from text: in the end, cloud is like a hotel: *all the comfort and resources you need, none of the stress
. You get to focus on “what matters” (for a traveler, the trip; for a developer, building the application) while the provider handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

One more subtlety:

 Multi-tenancy: A hotel has many guests in separate rooms under one roof. Cloud often runs multiple customers' workloads on shared hardware (with isolation). This is like many guests in one big building – more efficient than each having a separate building, but requires trust that each room is secure and private (cloud uses virtualization and security to isolate tenants).

 Different service models: There’s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS – renting raw VMs, akin to just getting a room), Platform as a Service (PaaS – like having a serviced apartment or catered environment where more is managed for you), Software as a Service (SaaS – like just using a service in the hotel without even needing your own room, e.g., using hotel’s laundry service vs having your own laundry machines).
 But in general, the analogy of renting vs owning covers IaaS mainly and conceptually the others too (with PaaS/ SaaS being even more managed – more hotel services included).

From a network analogy perspective, this chapter shifts from pure networking to computing resource management, but it still ties in: earlier chapters set how networking works, and cloud computing leverages those networks to deliver compute as a utility.
Technical Perspective:

 Cloud providers have massive data centers divided into regions and availability zones. They offer virtual machines, storage, databases, etc. via APIs.

 Users can spin up 100 servers in minutes (scale up) and shut them down when done (scale down). They pay per second or minute of use in many cases.

 The provider handles tasks like:

 Procuring hardware, powering/cooling it.

 Replacing failed components.

 Updating hypervisors or base systems.

 Multi-tenant security (ensuring one VM can't interfere with another).

 Network connectivity – likely providing high-speed links, firewalls, load balancers as on-demand services.

 E.g., AWS EC2 (elastic compute cloud) – IaaS offering. AWS Lambda (serverless computing) – abstracting even the server concept (like hotel doing everything for you including cooking, you just bring the code).

 Cloud essentially turns IT into a utility: like electricity – you plug in and use what you need, pay per use.

So "Hotels in the Cloud" covers how the networking and computing analogy extends to modern cloud computing – a very apt analogy widely used even in tech circles (rent vs own, cloud provider as hotel manager etc.).

Now presumably, after explaining cloud, they go into subheadings Cloud Flexibility, No Maintenance, etc., which we integrated above. We should ensure we hit each:
