Few words before moving on:
There is no such thing as DevOps Engineer, DevOps is a philosophy, a way of working. Your DevOps role will depend on your organization structure and maturity. Some organizations use DevOps, SRE and Platform engineering interchangeably, don’t worry. Focus on the goal. You will work in a team, empathy is mandatory.

You will work in a team, empathy is mandatory. A lot of people ask, do I really need to know ___ALL OF THAT___ to work as a DevOps Engineer? Short answer is: no, most probably someone in your team or organization already knows how to do stuff, leverage them!! ask questions!!\nLong answer is: yes, this role tends to be more complex than it should and I think a big part is communication and how people organize within a team. See Conway’s law for example.\nOf course, the wide range of tools and stacks makes it complex but nothing like a good ol’ draw.io to help you visualize what’s happening.\nYour goal Help your team in identifying problems, scoping them and making them disappear. Rinse and repeat.\nKnow your tooling Once you start working as DevOps “engineer”, specially if you come from a sysadmin or development background, you will start noticing a lot of patterns in the tooling and stacks, identify them as quickly as possible and create mental maps of why they are useful.\nThen learn how to separate the “why” and the “what” and start mastering the “why” of the tooling.\nMastering the why will help you understand the concepts and reason about why they are necessary. So next time you move from Github to Gitlab for example, you will notice that they both do the (almost) same thing just with a different logo.\nKnow your people Coming back to people. You have to recognize that your success and impact as DevOps “engineer” is your ability to communicate and understand people.\nAnd you will find people from different backgrounds, experience and personalities, that’s ok, use that diversity as a strength rather than as a challenge.\nCommunication Learn to articulate and be precise in your speech and writing. It will make your life and your team’s life easier\nAnd yes, you will need to write pipelines :)\n","wordCount":"368","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-01T06:53:23Z","dateModified":"2025-08-11T15:53:34+09:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Memo Garcia"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://memo.mx/posts/being-devops/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Memo Garcia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://memo.mx/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://memo.mx/ accesskey=h title="Memo Garcia (Alt + H)">Memo Garcia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://memo.mx/tools title=Tools><span>Tools</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/dayjob title=$DAYJOB><span>$DAYJOB</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/startup title=Startup><span>Startup</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/youtube title=YouTube><span>YouTube</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/books title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>So, you want to be a DevOps Engineer?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-01 06:53:23 +0000 UTC'>August 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Memo Garcia</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#your-goal aria-label="Your goal">Your goal</a></li><li><a href=#know-your-tooling aria-label="Know your tooling">Know your tooling</a></li><li><a href=#know-your-people aria-label="Know your people">Know your people</a></li><li><a href=#communication aria-label=Communication>Communication</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>First of, congratulations!</p><p>Few words before moving on:</p><ol><li>There is no such thing as <code>DevOps Engineer</code>, DevOps is a philosophy, a way of working.</li><li>Your DevOps role will depend on your organization structure and maturity.
