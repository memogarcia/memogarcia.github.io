  <section><h2 id="why-is-this-important">“Why is this important”?</h2>
<p>Good senior engineers always ask “why” this feature, or function or even project is necessary.</p>
<p>Understanding “why” allows them to make decisions on “what” to do, “how” to do it and even how to take shortcuts to get there.</p>
<p>They also understand “why” target users would want these features in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="clear-communication">Clear communication</h2>
<p>Good senior engineers always strive to be good communicators.</p>
<p>They document everything, from code to the decision making process and agreements between people involved in a project.</p>
<p>This I find to be really useful because sometimes decisions happen in a 1-to-1 teams meeting without anyone knowing.</p>
<p>They also aim to be as precise, verbose and clear as possible.</p>
<h2 id="done-must-mean-done">Done must mean done.</h2>
<p>Not 80% done, not 95% done, done must mean 100% done. If not, be honest and clear to your team and management about the state of the work.</p>
<h2 id="no">No</h2>
<p>They prevent management from making bad decisions by saying <strong>No</strong> to “bad” decisions.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-improvement">Continuous improvement</h2>
<p>They balance moving a project forward with the maintenance required for fix technical debt.</p>
<p>They create a flow of work where new features are mixed with fixing technical debt to avoid creation “tickets” for improvements, thus avoiding management from not prioritizing this kind of work.</p>
