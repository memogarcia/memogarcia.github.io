That Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC, is our secure, isolated section of the hotel. It has its own rules, its own guards, and its own private hallways. It’s a great setup. But what happens when your employees, working on your private floor, need to visit one of the hotel’s own amenities, like the massive hotel gym or the central archives?\nThe most obvious way would be to leave your private floor, go down the elevator, walk through the main lobby, and head out onto the public street. Then you would walk down the block and re-enter the hotel through the gym’s public entrance. It works, but it feels a bit strange, doesn’t it? You never actually left the hotel grounds, but you exposed yourself to the public street just to get from one part of the hotel to another.\nThis is what happens when a service inside your VPC needs to talk to a major cloud service, like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. By default, that conversation often travels over the public internet. Your data leaves your private network, travels through the wild, and then re-enters the cloud provider’s network. It’s like taking a public street to get to your own hotel’s gym.\nThere has to be a better way. And there is: a private service door.\nThe Private Hallway to Hotel Services A VPC Endpoint is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a private, secure connection between your VPC and another cloud service that doesn’t require the public internet. Instead of walking the public street, you’re using a secure, staff-only hallway that connects you directly to the gym. Your data never gets exposed. This is a huge win for security, and it can often be faster and cheaper too.\nNow, the hotel offers two kinds of private doors, depending on what you need.\nThe Gateway Endpoint: A Direct Tunnel to the Utility Room Think of the first type, a Gateway Endpoint, as a special, high-speed tunnel from your floor’s main junction to one of the hotel’s massive, shared utilities. This isn’t for visiting a small boutique; this is for connecting to something enormous, like the hotel’s power grid or its central water supply. In the world of AWS, this applies specifically to their foundational services: S3 (the storage warehouse) and DynamoDB (the massive key-value database).\nYou don’t give the power grid a room number on your floor. That would not make sense. Instead, you update your floor’s directory (the route table) to say, “All requests for power should go through this special, private tunnel.” It’s incredibly efficient for these specific, large-scale services.\nThe Interface Endpoint: A Private Door on Your Floor The second type, an Interface Endpoint, is more like having a brand new, private door installed directly on your floor. This door leads to a specific hotel service, and that service actually gets its own room number (a private IP address) right in your hallway.\nWhen you use an Interface Endpoint, it feels like the service is located right there on your floor. You can talk to it just like you would talk to any other room in your private district. You can even put one of your own security guards (a Security Group) right at its door to control who on your floor can access it. This approach is far more common and works with a much wider variety of services. It’s the difference between a special tunnel to the power grid and a private, guarded door to the hotel’s accounting department.\nThe Private Service Hatch So far, we have been talking about accessing the hotel’s own services. But what if another company, renting the floor above you, has a specialized service you want to use? Maybe they have a high-tech printing press you need access to.\nYou probably do not want to connect your entire floor to their entire floor. That would be a security nightmare. Instead, they can open a “private service hatch” just for you. This is the idea behind AWS PrivateLink.\nPrivateLink allows another service (even one from a completely different company) to appear as a private Interface Endpoint on your floor. It gets a room number in your hallway, and you can access it securely, as if it were your own. All the traffic stays within the hotel’s private network. It’s a secure, one-to-one connection that keeps everyone’s business separate and safe.\nThinking about private access inside the cloud can be tricky. Just remember the hotel.\nVPC Endpoints are your private doors to the hotel’s own services, keeping you off the public street. Gateway Endpoints are special tunnels for massive utilities like S3, configured in your floor’s directory. Interface Endpoints, on the other hand, put a private door for a service right on your floor, complete with its own room number. And when you need to securely use a neighbor’s service, they can open a PrivateLink for you, which acts like a private service hatch directly into your hallway.\nThese private connections are fundamental to building secure and efficient systems in the cloud.\nChapter 29: The Many Exits of the Hotel Our private floor in the cloud hotel is designed for security and isolation. Most of the rooms are for internal work, safely tucked away from the public. But we live in a connected world, and sometimes, our rooms need to interact with the city outside. They might need to get information from the city library (an external API) or download the latest safety codes (software updates).\nSo, how do people or data get in and out of our private district? A building needs doors. In the cloud, our private district needs gateways.\nJust like a real hotel, there isn’t just one type of door. There’s the grand main entrance for announced visitors, and then there are the discreet, staff-only exits in the back. Let’s look at both.\nThe Grand Main Entrance: The Internet Gateway An Internet Gateway is the hotel’s main entrance. It’s a big, two-way door to the public internet. People from the outside can come in, and people from the inside can go out. This is the gateway you need for any room in your district that must be publicly reachable.\nImagine you have a public-facing business on your floor, like a marketing office that receives clients. You want clients from anywhere in the city to be able to find it and walk right in. For this to work, that office needs two things. First, it needs a public, registered address that people can find in the city directory (an Elastic IP address). Second, there must be a path from the main hotel entrance to its front door.\nThat’s precisely what an Internet Gateway does. It connects your private district to the internet and, when combined with the city directory (DNS) and your floor’s internal directions (route tables), allows the outside world to reach a specific, designated room. The security guard (Firewall or Security Group) is still there, of course, checking IDs and making sure only the right visitors get in. But the path is open. It’s a two-way street.\nThe Staff-Only Exit: The NAT Gateway Now, think about all the other rooms on your floor. These are your back-office workers, your internal databases, your application servers. They are doing the private, internal work of your company. You never, ever want a random person from the street to be able to walk up to their door.\nBut, these workers still need to access the outside world sometimes. They need to run to the store for supplies (download a security patch) or call a vendor for a price check (query an external data source). They need to get out, but you can’t let the public in.\nFor this, you use a NAT Gateway. Think of it as a monitored, staff-only exit at the back of the hotel.\nYour internal workers can go to this exit and head out into the city. The guard at the door (the NAT Gateway) makes a note of who left and what they went to get. When the worker returns with their supplies, the guard checks their note and says, “Ah, you went to get software updates. I know which room you came from, let me send you back there.”\nCrucially, no one from the outside can initiate a conversation through this door. The guard will stop them immediately. It is strictly for traffic that is leaving first and then returning. This is a callback to the mail forwarding service we discussed in Chapter 16, but the NAT Gateway is a fully managed, highly reliable service built for the massive scale of the cloud city.\nEvery private district needs a way to talk to the outside world. The key is choosing the right door for the right job.\nThe Internet Gateway is your main, two-way entrance. You attach it to your district when you have public-facing rooms, like web servers, that need to accept traffic directly from the internet.\nThe NAT Gateway is your secure, one-way exit. Your private, internal rooms use it to go out and fetch things from the internet without ever allowing anyone from the outside to initiate contact with them.\nUsing the right exit is the difference between a secure, orderly hotel and a chaotic free-for-all.\nChapter 30: The Hotel’s Internal Phonebook Back in Chapter 14, we learned about the City Directory, the DNS that lets us find the street address for any named business in the city. It’s the master phonebook for the public internet, translating friendly names like google.com into the IP addresses that routers need.\nThat’s great for finding your way around the city. But what about finding your way around your own private floor in the hotel?\nImagine you’re in room 1201 and you need to send a message to the accounting service, which you know is somewhere on your floor. You could try to remember its room number, say 1255. But what if the accounting service moves to a bigger room, 1288, to handle more work? Or what if there are three identical accounting rooms to handle the load, and you could talk to any of them?\nRemembering room numbers is brittle. They change. Shouting down the hallway to ask where the accounting service is located is noisy and inefficient. You need a better system. You need an internal phonebook.\nThe Private Directory: Cloud DNS This is where cloud-native DNS services, like Amazon Route 53’s private hosted zones, come into play. Think of this as a private phonebook, available only to people on your floor (your VPC). This phonebook lists all your internal services by easy-to-remember names, but it maps them to their private room numbers (their private IP addresses).\nSo, you can have entries like database.internal or auth-service.corp. When a service in your VPC asks for database.internal, the private DNS service looks it up in the internal phonebook and replies, “You can find that in room 1234.” It never consults the main City Directory because this name is not meant for the public.\nThe beauty of this is that it decouples the service’s name from its location. If the database server needs to be replaced or moved to a new room number, you only have to update the single entry in your internal phonebook. All the other services that talk to the database don’t need to change a thing. They can keep asking for database.internal just like they always have. This makes your entire system more flexible and resilient.\nThe Self-Updating Phonebook: Service Discovery An internal phonebook is great, but what happens in a truly dynamic cloud environment? Imagine your hotel is so busy that new employees are constantly showing up and old ones are leaving. Your application might be starting and stopping new servers every few minutes to keep up with demand (a concept known as auto-scaling).\nManually updating the phonebook in this scenario would be a nightmare. No human could keep up. This is where the magic of service discovery comes in.\nService discovery is like a dynamic, self-updating phonebook. It’s a system where, as soon as a new service (a new room or employee) comes online, it automatically registers itself with the directory. “Hi, I’m a new billing service, and you can reach me in room 1502.” When it shuts down, it automatically de-registers itself.\nNow, other services don’t even need to know a specific name. They can simply ask the directory, “Hey, can you give me the location of a healthy billing service?” The directory provides them with a list of current, available rooms. This allows your applications to be incredibly dynamic, automatically adjusting to load without anyone having to manually update lists of IP addresses.\nJust as the city needs a public directory, your private district needs its own internal phonebook.\nPrivate DNS gives you that internal directory, letting you use stable, friendly names for your internal services without worrying about their specific room numbers. It makes your architecture more robust and easier to manage.\nService discovery takes this a step further, creating a magical, self-updating phonebook that is essential for modern, auto-scaling applications. It’s the key to navigating the ever-changing landscape of the cloud city.\nChapter 31: Hall Cameras and Logbooks We have spent many chapters designing and building our network. We have our local building, our private district in the cloud city, and a whole host of services running inside. Everything is connected. But what happens when something goes wrong?\nA service is running slow. A connection is failing. As the architect and manager of this system, how do you diagnose the problem? You can’t just wander the hallways and guess. You need visibility. You need to see the traffic, track the patterns, and follow the requests. You need cameras, logbooks, and trackers.\nThis is the world of network observability.\nThe Hall Cameras: VPC Flow Logs Imagine you had security cameras installed in every single hallway of your private district. These cameras don’t record video of people, but they create a text log of every single trip anyone makes. This log would show:\nWho started the trip (the source IP address). Where they were going (the destination IP address). Which door they tried to use (the port). Whether the guard let them in (the accept or reject status). How much they were carrying (the number of bytes). This is exactly what a VPC Flow Log is. It is a detailed record of all the IP traffic that attempts to travel in, out, or within your VPC. It’s an incredibly powerful tool for troubleshooting. If service A can’t talk to service B, you can check the flow logs. Did the request from service A even make it to service B’s door? Did the security guard (Security Group or NACL) reject the request? The flow log holds the answer.\nThese logs are also vital for security audits. Do you want to know if anyone from an unauthorized room tried to access the finance database last night? The flow logs will tell you. It’s the ultimate source of truth for network traffic.\nThe Concierge’s Logbook: Network Metrics The camera footage is fantastic for granular detail, but sometimes you need a higher-level view. You don’t need to see every individual trip; you need to know how busy the hallways are in general. For this, you’d look at the concierge’s logbook.\nThis logbook contains summaries and trends. It might say, “The hallway leading to the database floor was extremely congested at 3:00 PM,” or “The main elevator saw a sudden 50% drop in traffic this morning.”\nThese are your network metrics. Services like Amazon CloudWatch collect this data automatically. You can build dashboards that show you things like NetworkIn, NetworkOut, PacketLoss, and Latency. These metrics are your first stop for spotting performance bottlenecks. If a service suddenly becomes slow, a quick look at your metrics dashboard might show a huge spike in traffic or a sudden increase in latency, pointing you in the right direction without you having to sift through millions of individual log entries.\nFollowing a Single Request: Tracing Sometimes, a problem is more complex. A customer’s request comes into your application, and it has to talk to three different internal services to be fulfilled. The customer says the whole process was slow, but which part was the bottleneck?\nThis is where tracing comes in. Think of it as assigning a personal assistant to follow one specific request as it journeys through your entire system. This assistant carries a stopwatch and a notepad.\nWhen the request arrives at the first service, the assistant notes the time. When that service calls the next one, the assistant follows, noting how long the trip took. They follow the request from room to room, from floor to floor, until the final answer is sent back to the customer. The final report is a detailed timeline showing exactly how long the request spent in each service and in each hallway between them. This allows you to immediately pinpoint the source of a delay. Was it the authentication service? The database query? The network in between? Tracing tells you exactly where the time was spent.\nBuilding a network without observability is like managing a hotel with the lights off. You need to be able to see what’s going on.\nVPC Flow Logs are your detailed hall cameras, giving you a record of every single network connection attempt. They are your ground truth for troubleshooting and security.\nNetwork Metrics are the concierge’s logbook, providing high-level summaries and trends to help you spot performance issues at a glance.\nTracing is the personal assistant who follows a single request from start to finish, creating a detailed timeline that pinpoints the exact source of a delay.\nTogether, these three pillars of observability allow you to manage, debug, and secure your network effectively.\nChapter 32: Room Service on Demand For most of this book, we’ve been thinking about our systems in terms of rooms. We rent a room (a server), we decide how big it is, we furnish it (install software), and we manage it. If we need more capacity, we rent more rooms. This model has served us well, from a single room in our apartment building to an entire private floor in the cloud hotel.\nBut what if you don’t want to manage a room at all? What if you just need a task done?\nThink about it like this. When you’re hungry, you could rent a kitchen, hire a chef, buy ingredients, and have them on standby 24/7 just in case you want a meal. That’s the traditional server model. It’s powerful and gives you full control, but it can be a lot of overhead if you only eat one meal a day.\nWhat’s the alternative? You could just order room service.\nThis is the core idea behind serverless computing.\nThe Magic of Room Service With serverless functions (like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions), you don’t manage servers, rooms, or kitchens. You simply write a piece of code that performs a task, and you tell the cloud provider when to run it. You pick up the phone, place an order (“I need this task done”), and a few moments later, the result is delivered to your door.\nYou don’t know who the chef was. You don’t know which of the hotel’s many kitchens they used. You don’t know how they sourced their ingredients or managed their staff. All you know is that you got the result you asked for. This is the magic of abstraction.\nBest of all, you only pay for the one meal you ordered. You’re not paying to keep a chef and a kitchen on standby all day. For tasks that are short-lived and event-driven, this can be an incredibly efficient and cost-effective model.\nNetworking for the Chef This all sounds great, but as network architects, we have to ask a critical question: what does the network look like for that ephemeral chef?\nBy default, the chef works in the hotel’s main kitchen complex, which is outside of your private floor. If the task is simple, like adding two numbers, that’s fine. But what if the recipe requires a special ingredient from a private fridge you keep on your floor (a database inside your VPC)?\nNow things get interesting. The chef, working in the main hotel kitchen, needs to get into your private, secure hallway to access your fridge. How do we allow this securely?\nThis is where serverless networking comes in. You can configure your serverless function to have access to your private VPC. When you do this, the cloud provider sets up a special, secure access point for the function directly into your hallway. In technical terms, the service places an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) inside your VPC, which gets its own private IP address, its own “room number.”\nNow, when your function runs, it’s as if the chef is temporarily working from a small, secure kitchenette located right on your floor. They can access your private database or other internal services just like any other room on your floor. And of course, you can place your own door guards (Security Groups) on that access point, ensuring the chef can only talk to the specific fridges and pantries they have permission to use.\nA New Way of Thinking The serverless model challenges the “room” as the fundamental unit of our system. Instead of building and managing rooms, we start thinking in terms of events and tasks. It’s perfect for jobs like, “When a new photo is uploaded to the storage warehouse, automatically resize it,” or “When a customer clicks this button on the website, process their order.”\nYou wouldn’t run your entire 24/7 database as a series of room service orders, but for countless event-driven tasks, it’s a simpler, more powerful, and often cheaper way to build.\nLet the hotel analogy guide you when thinking about serverless.\nTraditional servers are like renting, furnishing, and managing your own private kitchen, keeping it running 24/7. It gives you total control, but you pay for it whether you’re using it or not.\nServerless is like ordering room service. You give up control of the underlying kitchen in exchange for the convenience of just placing an order and getting a result. You only pay for the tasks you run.\nFrom a networking perspective, if your room service order (your function) needs to access private resources, you must grant it secure access to your floor (your VPC). The cloud provider handles the logistics, giving your task a temporary, secure place in your private network to get the job done.\nChapter 33: Hotels in Other Cities Our cloud hotel has been a stunning success. We have a secure private floor, efficient services, and happy customers. Our entire business is running beautifully out of our single, magnificent skyscraper in, let’s say, Tokyo.\nBut then, a question keeps you up at night: what if something happens to Tokyo? A city-wide power outage, a major earthquake, or even a temporary, large-scale internet disruption in the region could shut down our entire hotel. If the hotel is offline, our business is offline. That’s a huge risk.\nFurthermore, we’re getting more and more customers from Europe. They love our service, but they complain that the connection feels a bit slow. It’s a long way for a request to travel from London to Tokyo and back.\nTo solve both problems, we need to stop thinking about a single hotel. We need to start thinking about a global hotel chain. We need to build in other cities.\nExpanding the Hotel Chain: Multi-Region Architecture In cloud computing, a “region” is a distinct, isolated geographical area where a provider operates data centers. Think of the us-east-1 region in Virginia as the New York City of the cloud, and the eu-west-2 region as London. They are completely separate.\nGoing “multi-region” means building a copy of your application in more than one of these cities. It’s like building a new, fully functional branch of your hotel in London when your first one is in Tokyo. This new London hotel is a complete replica. It has its own private floors (VPCs), its own rooms (servers), its own concierge (router), and its own local staff.\nThis strategy gives us two incredible advantages.\nDisaster Recovery: If a massive typhoon takes our entire Tokyo hotel offline, it’s a problem, but it’s not a catastrophe. We can redirect all of our customers and traffic to the London branch. Our business stays online, and we can work on bringing the Tokyo hotel back without the pressure of a complete outage. This is the foundation of a robust disaster recovery plan.\nReduced Latency: For all our customers in Europe, the experience is now dramatically better. Instead of their requests traveling halfway around the world to Tokyo, they are now routed to the much closer London hotel. The service feels faster and more responsive. This is how you serve a global audience effectively.\nDirecting Global Traffic Now we have two hotels. How do customers find the right one? And how do the hotels talk to each other to make sure their data (like reservation lists) stays in sync?\nFor the first problem, we use a global traffic director. This is a more advanced version of the City Directory (DNS) we’ve already discussed. Using services like Amazon Route 53, we can set up intelligent routing policies.\nLatency-Based Routing: When a customer tries to connect, the system checks where they are coming from and automatically sends them to the hotel that will give them the fastest response time (the lowest latency). Someone in Spain gets sent to London; someone in Japan gets sent to Tokyo. Geolocation Routing: We can even get more specific. If we have a version of our service just for customers in Germany (perhaps for legal reasons), we can ensure that anyone connecting from Germany is always sent to our hotel in Frankfurt. Failover Routing: This is for disaster recovery. We can set it up so that all traffic normally goes to Tokyo. But if the system detects that the Tokyo hotel is unhealthy, it will automatically reroute all new traffic to the London hotel until Tokyo is back online. For the second problem, how do the hotels communicate? Major cloud providers have their own private, secure, high-speed global networks connecting all of their regions. When our London hotel needs to sync its database with the Tokyo hotel, it doesn’t send that sensitive data over the public internet. It uses the cloud provider’s own private backbone. It’s like our hotel chain has its own private airline, flying data securely between our branches at high speed.\nDo not put all your eggs in one basket, and do not build your entire business in a single city.\nA single cloud region is a single point of failure. To build a truly resilient and global application, you need to expand your hotel chain to other cities (go multi-region). This protects you from disaster and provides a faster experience for your international customers.\nYou use a smart, global reservation system (intelligent DNS routing) to direct customers to the closest or healthiest hotel. And your hotels use the chain’s own private airline (the cloud provider’s global backbone network) to communicate with each other securely and efficiently.\n","wordCount":"4585","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-10-18T22:39:16+09:00","dateModified":"2025-10-19T11:44:42+09:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Memo Garcia"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://memo.mx/posts/understanding-computer-networks-by-analogy-part-3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Memo Garcia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://memo.mx/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://memo.mx/ accesskey=h title="Memo Garcia (Alt + H)">Memo Garcia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://memo.mx/labs/ title=Labs><span>Labs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Understanding Computer Networks by Analogy: Part 3 - Streets, Names, and Guards</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-10-18 22:39:16 +0900 +0900'>October 18, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;22 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Memo Garcia</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#part-3--mastering-the-cloud-city aria-label="Part 3 · Mastering the Cloud City">Part 3 · Mastering the Cloud City</a><ul><li><a href=#chapter-28-service-doors--private-hatches aria-label="Chapter 28: Service Doors &amp;amp;

That Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC, is our secure, isolated section of the hotel. It has its own rules, its own guards, and its own private hallways. It’s a great setup. But what happens when your employees, working on your private floor, need to visit one of the hotel’s own amenities, like the massive hotel gym or the central archives?</p><p>The most obvious way would be to leave your private floor, go down the elevator, walk through the main lobby, and head out onto the public street. Then you would walk down the block and re-enter the hotel through the gym’s public entrance. It works, but it feels a bit strange, doesn&rsquo;t it? You never actually left the hotel grounds, but you exposed yourself to the public street just to get from one part of the hotel to another.</p><p>This is what happens when a service inside your VPC needs to talk to a major cloud service, like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. By default, that conversation often travels over the public internet. Your data leaves your private network, travels through the wild, and then re-enters the cloud provider&rsquo;s network. It’s like taking a public street to get to your own hotel&rsquo;s gym.</p><p>There has to be a better way. And there is: a private service door.</p><h2 id=the-private-hallway-to-hotel-services>The Private Hallway to Hotel Services<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-private-hallway-to-hotel-services>#</a></h2><p>A VPC Endpoint is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a private, secure connection between your VPC and another cloud service that doesn’t require the public internet. Instead of walking the public street, you’re using a secure, staff-only hallway that connects you directly to the gym. Your data never gets exposed. This is a huge win for security, and it can often be faster and cheaper too.</p><p>Now, the hotel offers two kinds of private doors, depending on what you need.</p><h3 id=the-gateway-endpoint-a-direct-tunnel-to-the-utility-room>The Gateway Endpoint: A Direct Tunnel to the Utility Room<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-gateway-endpoint-a-direct-tunnel-to-the-utility-room>#</a></h3><p>Think of the first type, a Gateway Endpoint, as a special, high-speed tunnel from your floor’s main junction to one of the hotel’s massive, shared utilities. This isn&rsquo;t for visiting a small boutique; this is for connecting to something enormous, like the hotel&rsquo;s power grid or its central water supply. In the world of AWS, this applies specifically to their foundational services: S3 (the storage warehouse) and DynamoDB (the massive key-value database).</p><p>You don’t give the power grid a room number on your floor. That would not make sense. Instead, you update your floor’s directory (the route table) to say, &ldquo;All requests for power should go through this special, private tunnel.&rdquo; It’s incredibly efficient for these specific, large-scale services.</p><h3 id=the-interface-endpoint-a-private-door-on-your-floor>The Interface Endpoint: A Private Door on Your Floor<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-interface-endpoint-a-private-door-on-your-floor>#</a></h3><p>The second type, an Interface Endpoint, is more like having a brand new, private door installed directly on your floor. This door leads to a specific hotel service, and that service actually gets its own room number (a private IP address) right in your hallway.</p><p>When you use an Interface Endpoint, it feels like the service is located right there on your floor. You can talk to it just like you would talk to any other room in your private district. You can even put one of your own security guards (a Security Group) right at its door to control who on your floor can access it. This approach is far more common and works with a much wider variety of services. It’s the difference between a special tunnel to the power grid and a private, guarded door to the hotel&rsquo;s accounting department.</p><h2 id=the-private-service-hatch>The Private Service Hatch<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-private-service-hatch>#</a></h2><p>So far, we have been talking about accessing the hotel&rsquo;s own services. But what if another company, renting the floor above you, has a specialized service you want to use? Maybe they have a high-tech printing press you need access to.</p><p>You probably do not want to connect your entire floor to their entire floor. That would be a security nightmare. Instead, they can open a &ldquo;private service hatch&rdquo; just for you. This is the idea behind AWS PrivateLink.</p><p>PrivateLink allows another service (even one from a completely different company) to appear as a private Interface Endpoint on your floor. It gets a room number in your hallway, and you can access it securely, as if it were your own. All the traffic stays within the hotel&rsquo;s private network. It’s a secure, one-to-one connection that keeps everyone’s business separate and safe.</p><blockquote><p>Thinking about private access inside the cloud can be tricky. Just remember the hotel.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>VPC Endpoints are your private doors to the hotel&rsquo;s own services, keeping you off the public street. Gateway Endpoints are special tunnels for massive utilities like S3, configured in your floor&rsquo;s directory. Interface Endpoints, on the other hand, put a private door for a service right on your floor, complete with its own room number. And when you need to securely use a neighbor&rsquo;s service, they can open a PrivateLink for you, which acts like a private service hatch directly into your hallway.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>These private connections are fundamental to building secure and efficient systems in the cloud.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=chapter-29-the-many-exits-of-the-hotel>Chapter 29: The Many Exits of the Hotel<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-29-the-many-exits-of-the-hotel>#</a></h2><p>Our private floor in the cloud hotel is designed for security and isolation. Most of the rooms are for internal work, safely tucked away from the public. But we live in a connected world, and sometimes, our rooms need to interact with the city outside. They might need to get information from the city library (an external API) or download the latest safety codes (software updates).</p><p>So, how do people or data get in and out of our private district? A building needs doors. In the cloud, our private district needs gateways.</p><p>Just like a real hotel, there isn’t just one type of door. There’s the grand main entrance for announced visitors, and then there are the discreet, staff-only exits in the back. Let’s look at both.</p><h2 id=the-grand-main-entrance-the-internet-gateway>The Grand Main Entrance: The Internet Gateway<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-grand-main-entrance-the-internet-gateway>#</a></h2><p>An Internet Gateway is the hotel’s main entrance. It’s a big, two-way door to the public internet. People from the outside can come in, and people from the inside can go out. This is the gateway you need for any room in your district that must be publicly reachable.</p><p>Imagine you have a public-facing business on your floor, like a marketing office that receives clients. You want clients from anywhere in the city to be able to find it and walk right in. For this to work, that office needs two things. First, it needs a public, registered address that people can find in the city directory (an Elastic IP address). Second, there must be a path from the main hotel entrance to its front door.</p><p>That’s precisely what an Internet Gateway does. It connects your private district to the internet and, when combined with the city directory (DNS) and your floor’s internal directions (route tables), allows the outside world to reach a specific, designated room. The security guard (Firewall or Security Group) is still there, of course, checking IDs and making sure only the right visitors get in. But the path is open. It’s a two-way street.</p><h2 id=the-staff-only-exit-the-nat-gateway>The Staff-Only Exit: The NAT Gateway<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-staff-only-exit-the-nat-gateway>#</a></h2><p>Now, think about all the other rooms on your floor. These are your back-office workers, your internal databases, your application servers. They are doing the private, internal work of your company. You never, ever want a random person from the street to be able to walk up to their door.</p><p>But, these workers still need to access the outside world sometimes. They need to run to the store for supplies (download a security patch) or call a vendor for a price check (query an external data source). They need to get <em>out</em>, but you can’t let the public <em>in</em>.</p><p>For this, you use a NAT Gateway. Think of it as a monitored, staff-only exit at the back of the hotel.</p><p>Your internal workers can go to this exit and head out into the city. The guard at the door (the NAT Gateway) makes a note of who left and what they went to get. When the worker returns with their supplies, the guard checks their note and says, “Ah, you went to get software updates. I know which room you came from, let me send you back there.”</p><p>Crucially, no one from the outside can initiate a conversation through this door. The guard will stop them immediately. It is strictly for traffic that is leaving first and then returning. This is a callback to the mail forwarding service we discussed in Chapter 16, but the NAT Gateway is a fully managed, highly reliable service built for the massive scale of the cloud city.</p><blockquote><p>Every private district needs a way to talk to the outside world. The key is choosing the right door for the right job.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Internet Gateway is your main, two-way entrance. You attach it to your district when you have public-facing rooms, like web servers, that need to accept traffic directly from the internet.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The NAT Gateway is your secure, one-way exit. Your private, internal rooms use it to go out and fetch things from the internet without ever allowing anyone from the outside to initiate contact with them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Using the right exit is the difference between a secure, orderly hotel and a chaotic free-for-all.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=chapter-30-the-hotels-internal-phonebook>Chapter 30: The Hotel&rsquo;s Internal Phonebook<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-30-the-hotels-internal-phonebook>#</a></h2><p>Back in Chapter 14, we learned about the City Directory, the DNS that lets us find the street address for any named business in the city. It’s the master phonebook for the public internet, translating friendly names like <code>google.com</code> into the IP addresses that routers need.</p><p>That’s great for finding your way around the city. But what about finding your way around your own private floor in the hotel?</p><p>Imagine you’re in room 1201 and you need to send a message to the accounting service, which you know is somewhere on your floor. You could try to remember its room number, say 1255. But what if the accounting service moves to a bigger room, 1288, to handle more work? Or what if there are three identical accounting rooms to handle the load, and you could talk to any of them?</p><p>Remembering room numbers is brittle. They change. Shouting down the hallway to ask where the accounting service is located is noisy and inefficient. You need a better system. You need an internal phonebook.</p><h2 id=the-private-directory-cloud-dns>The Private Directory: Cloud DNS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-private-directory-cloud-dns>#</a></h2><p>This is where cloud-native DNS services, like Amazon Route 53’s private hosted zones, come into play. Think of this as a private phonebook, available only to people on your floor (your VPC). This phonebook lists all your internal services by easy-to-remember names, but it maps them to their private room numbers (their private IP addresses).</p><p>So, you can have entries like <code>database.internal</code> or <code>auth-service.corp</code>. When a service in your VPC asks for <code>database.internal</code>, the private DNS service looks it up in the internal phonebook and replies, “You can find that in room 1234.” It never consults the main City Directory because this name is not meant for the public.</p><p>The beauty of this is that it decouples the service’s name from its location. If the database server needs to be replaced or moved to a new room number, you only have to update the single entry in your internal phonebook. All the other services that talk to the database don’t need to change a thing. They can keep asking for <code>database.internal</code> just like they always have. This makes your entire system more flexible and resilient.</p><h2 id=the-self-updating-phonebook-service-discovery>The Self-Updating Phonebook: Service Discovery<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-self-updating-phonebook-service-discovery>#</a></h2><p>An internal phonebook is great, but what happens in a truly dynamic cloud environment? Imagine your hotel is so busy that new employees are constantly showing up and old ones are leaving. Your application might be starting and stopping new servers every few minutes to keep up with demand (a concept known as auto-scaling).</p><p>Manually updating the phonebook in this scenario would be a nightmare. No human could keep up. This is where the magic of service discovery comes in.</p><p>Service discovery is like a dynamic, self-updating phonebook. It’s a system where, as soon as a new service (a new room or employee) comes online, it automatically registers itself with the directory. “Hi, I’m a new billing service, and you can reach me in room 1502.” When it shuts down, it automatically de-registers itself.</p><p>Now, other services don’t even need to know a specific name. They can simply ask the directory, “Hey, can you give me the location of a healthy billing service?” The directory provides them with a list of current, available rooms. This allows your applications to be incredibly dynamic, automatically adjusting to load without anyone having to manually update lists of IP addresses.</p><blockquote><p>Just as the city needs a public directory, your private district needs its own internal phonebook.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Private DNS gives you that internal directory, letting you use stable, friendly names for your internal services without worrying about their specific room numbers. It makes your architecture more robust and easier to manage.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Service discovery takes this a step further, creating a magical, self-updating phonebook that is essential for modern, auto-scaling applications. It’s the key to navigating the ever-changing landscape of the cloud city.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=chapter-31-hall-cameras-and-logbooks>Chapter 31: Hall Cameras and Logbooks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-31-hall-cameras-and-logbooks>#</a></h2><p>We have spent many chapters designing and building our network. We have our local building, our private district in the cloud city, and a whole host of services running inside. Everything is connected. But what happens when something goes wrong?</p><p>A service is running slow. A connection is failing. As the architect and manager of this system, how do you diagnose the problem? You can’t just wander the hallways and guess. You need visibility. You need to see the traffic, track the patterns, and follow the requests. You need cameras, logbooks, and trackers.</p><p>This is the world of network observability.</p><h2 id=the-hall-cameras-vpc-flow-logs>The Hall Cameras: VPC Flow Logs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-hall-cameras-vpc-flow-logs>#</a></h2><p>Imagine you had security cameras installed in every single hallway of your private district. These cameras don’t record video of people, but they create a text log of every single trip anyone makes. This log would show:</p><ul><li>Who started the trip (the source IP address).</li><li>Where they were going (the destination IP address).</li><li>Which door they tried to use (the port).</li><li>Whether the guard let them in (the accept or reject status).</li><li>How much they were carrying (the number of bytes).</li></ul><p>This is exactly what a VPC Flow Log is. It is a detailed record of all the IP traffic that attempts to travel in, out, or within your VPC. It’s an incredibly powerful tool for troubleshooting. If service A can’t talk to service B, you can check the flow logs. Did the request from service A even make it to service B’s door? Did the security guard (Security Group or NACL) reject the request? The flow log holds the answer.</p><p>These logs are also vital for security audits. Do you want to know if anyone from an unauthorized room tried to access the finance database last night? The flow logs will tell you. It’s the ultimate source of truth for network traffic.</p><h2 id=the-concierges-logbook-network-metrics>The Concierge&rsquo;s Logbook: Network Metrics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-concierges-logbook-network-metrics>#</a></h2><p>The camera footage is fantastic for granular detail, but sometimes you need a higher-level view. You don’t need to see every individual trip; you need to know how busy the hallways are in general. For this, you’d look at the concierge’s logbook.</p><p>This logbook contains summaries and trends. It might say, “The hallway leading to the database floor was extremely congested at 3:00 PM,” or “The main elevator saw a sudden 50% drop in traffic this morning.”</p><p>These are your network metrics. Services like Amazon CloudWatch collect this data automatically. You can build dashboards that show you things like <code>NetworkIn</code>, <code>NetworkOut</code>, <code>PacketLoss</code>, and <code>Latency</code>. These metrics are your first stop for spotting performance bottlenecks. If a service suddenly becomes slow, a quick look at your metrics dashboard might show a huge spike in traffic or a sudden increase in latency, pointing you in the right direction without you having to sift through millions of individual log entries.</p><h2 id=following-a-single-request-tracing>Following a Single Request: Tracing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#following-a-single-request-tracing>#</a></h2><p>Sometimes, a problem is more complex. A customer’s request comes into your application, and it has to talk to three different internal services to be fulfilled. The customer says the whole process was slow, but which part was the bottleneck?</p><p>This is where tracing comes in. Think of it as assigning a personal assistant to follow one specific request as it journeys through your entire system. This assistant carries a stopwatch and a notepad.</p><p>When the request arrives at the first service, the assistant notes the time. When that service calls the next one, the assistant follows, noting how long the trip took. They follow the request from room to room, from floor to floor, until the final answer is sent back to the customer. The final report is a detailed timeline showing exactly how long the request spent in each service and in each hallway between them. This allows you to immediately pinpoint the source of a delay. Was it the authentication service? The database query? The network in between? Tracing tells you exactly where the time was spent.</p><blockquote><p>Building a network without observability is like managing a hotel with the lights off. You need to be able to see what’s going on.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>VPC Flow Logs</strong> are your detailed hall cameras, giving you a record of every single network connection attempt. They are your ground truth for troubleshooting and security.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Network Metrics</strong> are the concierge’s logbook, providing high-level summaries and trends to help you spot performance issues at a glance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tracing</strong> is the personal assistant who follows a single request from start to finish, creating a detailed timeline that pinpoints the exact source of a delay.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Together, these three pillars of observability allow you to manage, debug, and secure your network effectively.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=chapter-32-room-service-on-demand>Chapter 32: Room Service on Demand<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-32-room-service-on-demand>#</a></h2><p>For most of this book, we’ve been thinking about our systems in terms of rooms. We rent a room (a server), we decide how big it is, we furnish it (install software), and we manage it. If we need more capacity, we rent more rooms. This model has served us well, from a single room in our apartment building to an entire private floor in the cloud hotel.</p><p>But what if you don’t want to manage a room at all? What if you just need a task done?</p><p>Think about it like this. When you’re hungry, you could rent a kitchen, hire a chef, buy ingredients, and have them on standby 24/7 just in case you want a meal. That’s the traditional server model. It’s powerful and gives you full control, but it can be a lot of overhead if you only eat one meal a day.</p><p>What’s the alternative? You could just order room service.</p><p>This is the core idea behind serverless computing.</p><h2 id=the-magic-of-room-service>The Magic of Room Service<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-magic-of-room-service>#</a></h2><p>With serverless functions (like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions), you don’t manage servers, rooms, or kitchens. You simply write a piece of code that performs a task, and you tell the cloud provider when to run it. You pick up the phone, place an order (“I need this task done”), and a few moments later, the result is delivered to your door.</p><p>You don’t know who the chef was. You don’t know which of the hotel’s many kitchens they used. You don’t know how they sourced their ingredients or managed their staff. All you know is that you got the result you asked for. This is the magic of abstraction.</p><p>Best of all, you only pay for the one meal you ordered. You’re not paying to keep a chef and a kitchen on standby all day. For tasks that are short-lived and event-driven, this can be an incredibly efficient and cost-effective model.</p><h2 id=networking-for-the-chef>Networking for the Chef<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#networking-for-the-chef>#</a></h2><p>This all sounds great, but as network architects, we have to ask a critical question: what does the network look like for that ephemeral chef?</p><p>By default, the chef works in the hotel’s main kitchen complex, which is outside of your private floor. If the task is simple, like adding two numbers, that’s fine. But what if the recipe requires a special ingredient from a private fridge you keep on your floor (a database inside your VPC)?</p><p>Now things get interesting. The chef, working in the main hotel kitchen, needs to get into your private, secure hallway to access your fridge. How do we allow this securely?</p><p>This is where serverless networking comes in. You can configure your serverless function to have access to your private VPC. When you do this, the cloud provider sets up a special, secure access point for the function directly into your hallway. In technical terms, the service places an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) inside your VPC, which gets its own private IP address, its own “room number.”</p><p>Now, when your function runs, it’s as if the chef is temporarily working from a small, secure kitchenette located right on your floor. They can access your private database or other internal services just like any other room on your floor. And of course, you can place your own door guards (Security Groups) on that access point, ensuring the chef can only talk to the specific fridges and pantries they have permission to use.</p><h2 id=a-new-way-of-thinking>A New Way of Thinking<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-new-way-of-thinking>#</a></h2><p>The serverless model challenges the “room” as the fundamental unit of our system. Instead of building and managing rooms, we start thinking in terms of events and tasks. It’s perfect for jobs like, “When a new photo is uploaded to the storage warehouse, automatically resize it,” or “When a customer clicks this button on the website, process their order.”</p><p>You wouldn’t run your entire 24/7 database as a series of room service orders, but for countless event-driven tasks, it’s a simpler, more powerful, and often cheaper way to build.</p><blockquote><p>Let the hotel analogy guide you when thinking about serverless.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Traditional servers are like renting, furnishing, and managing your own private kitchen, keeping it running 24/7. It gives you total control, but you pay for it whether you’re using it or not.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Serverless is like ordering room service. You give up control of the underlying kitchen in exchange for the convenience of just placing an order and getting a result. You only pay for the tasks you run.</p></blockquote><p>From a networking perspective, if your room service order (your function) needs to access private resources, you must grant it secure access to your floor (your VPC). The cloud provider handles the logistics, giving your task a temporary, secure place in your private network to get the job done.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-33-hotels-in-other-cities>Chapter 33: Hotels in Other Cities<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-33-hotels-in-other-cities>#</a></h2><p>Our cloud hotel has been a stunning success. We have a secure private floor, efficient services, and happy customers. Our entire business is running beautifully out of our single, magnificent skyscraper in, let’s say, Tokyo.</p><p>But then, a question keeps you up at night: what if something happens to Tokyo? A city-wide power outage, a major earthquake, or even a temporary, large-scale internet disruption in the region could shut down our entire hotel. If the hotel is offline, our business is offline. That’s a huge risk.</p><p>Furthermore, we’re getting more and more customers from Europe. They love our service, but they complain that the connection feels a bit slow. It’s a long way for a request to travel from London to Tokyo and back.</p><p>To solve both problems, we need to stop thinking about a single hotel. We need to start thinking about a global hotel chain. We need to build in other cities.</p><h2 id=expanding-the-hotel-chain-multi-region-architecture>Expanding the Hotel Chain: Multi-Region Architecture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#expanding-the-hotel-chain-multi-region-architecture>#</a></h2><p>In cloud computing, a “region” is a distinct, isolated geographical area where a provider operates data centers. Think of the <code>us-east-1</code> region in Virginia as the New York City of the cloud, and the <code>eu-west-2</code> region as London. They are completely separate.</p><p>Going “multi-region” means building a copy of your application in more than one of these cities. It’s like building a new, fully functional branch of your hotel in London when your first one is in Tokyo. This new London hotel is a complete replica. It has its own private floors (VPCs), its own rooms (servers), its own concierge (router), and its own local staff.</p><p>This strategy gives us two incredible advantages.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> If a massive typhoon takes our entire Tokyo hotel offline, it’s a problem, but it’s not a catastrophe. We can redirect all of our customers and traffic to the London branch. Our business stays online, and we can work on bringing the Tokyo hotel back without the pressure of a complete outage. This is the foundation of a robust disaster recovery plan.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced Latency:</strong> For all our customers in Europe, the experience is now dramatically better. Instead of their requests traveling halfway around the world to Tokyo, they are now routed to the much closer London hotel. The service feels faster and more responsive. This is how you serve a global audience effectively.</p></li></ol><h2 id=directing-global-traffic>Directing Global Traffic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#directing-global-traffic>#</a></h2><p>Now we have two hotels. How do customers find the right one? And how do the hotels talk to each other to make sure their data (like reservation lists) stays in sync?</p><p>For the first problem, we use a global traffic director. This is a more advanced version of the City Directory (DNS) we’ve already discussed. Using services like Amazon Route 53, we can set up intelligent routing policies.</p><ul><li><strong>Latency-Based Routing:</strong> When a customer tries to connect, the system checks where they are coming from and automatically sends them to the hotel that will give them the fastest response time (the lowest latency). Someone in Spain gets sent to London; someone in Japan gets sent to Tokyo.</li><li><strong>Geolocation Routing:</strong> We can even get more specific. If we have a version of our service just for customers in Germany (perhaps for legal reasons), we can ensure that anyone connecting from Germany is always sent to our hotel in Frankfurt.</li><li><strong>Failover Routing:</strong> This is for disaster recovery. We can set it up so that all traffic normally goes to Tokyo. But if the system detects that the Tokyo hotel is unhealthy, it will automatically reroute all new traffic to the London hotel until Tokyo is back online.</li></ul><p>For the second problem, how do the hotels communicate? Major cloud providers have their own private, secure, high-speed global networks connecting all of their regions. When our London hotel needs to sync its database with the Tokyo hotel, it doesn’t send that sensitive data over the public internet. It uses the cloud provider’s own private backbone. It’s like our hotel chain has its own private airline, flying data securely between our branches at high speed.</p><blockquote><p>Do not put all your eggs in one basket, and do not build your entire business in a single city.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A single cloud region is a single point of failure. To build a truly resilient and global application, you need to expand your hotel chain to other cities (go multi-region). This protects you from disaster and provides a faster experience for your international customers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You use a smart, global reservation system (intelligent DNS routing) to direct customers to the closest or healthiest hotel. And your hotels use the chain’s own private airline (the cloud provider’s global backbone network) to communicate with each other securely and efficiently.</p></blockquote></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://memo.mx/posts/understanding-computer-networks-by-analogy-part-2/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Understanding Computer Networks by Analogy: Part 2 - The Hotel City (Cloud)</span>
