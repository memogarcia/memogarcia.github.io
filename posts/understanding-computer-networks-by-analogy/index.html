  <section><h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>There are many ways to learn something new and no approach is best. But, what works best for me is a combination of <code>trial and error</code> and learning by <code>first principles</code>. But, as someone once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge is only valuable when it leads to taking action on an idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as long as you share that knowledge you are taking action on an idea.</p>
<p>Just one big question is: <strong>how to share them?</strong>
I find that analogies are a great tool to do that.
They let you group together many ideas and present them as a whole to new audiences in a very fun way.</p>
<p>In this series of posts I propose a not so perfect analogy for computer networks represented as buildings.</p>
<h2 id="networks-or-the-buildings">Networks or &ldquo;The buildings&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This building represents a &ldquo;network&rdquo; of &ldquo;connected rooms&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Think of each room as a computer with a room number as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a>.</p>
<pre><code>room + room number == computer + ip address
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/img/building1.png" alt="building1"></p>
<p>In this network, each room can communicate directly to any other room using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/">network protocols</a> that will be represented as a <code>packages</code>.</p>
<p>But now you are wondering&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to send packages to all my neighbors&hellip;I just want to communicate with specific ones.</p>
<p>Enter the&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="subnets-or-the-floors">Subnets or &ldquo;The floors&rdquo;</h2>
<p>By dividing your building into floors you can now isolate the communication between them.
Neighbors in the 6th floor cannot communicate with neighbors in the 9th floor.</p>
<p>This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">subnet</a></p>
<p><img src="/img/floor1.png" alt="floor1"></p>
<p>You can identify the rooms by the room number or IP address.</p>
<p>Example room 69 can be idenfied as:</p>
<pre><code>floor 6, room 9
</code></pre>
<p>or as an IP address:</p>
<pre><code>192.168.6.9
</code></pre>
<p>This room number is unique to your building but the next building can have a room 69 in its building as well (I will cover this in a later post about private vs public IPs).</p>
<h2 id="computers-or-the-rooms">Computers or &ldquo;The rooms&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In reality, your room number is not tied to the physical space in the building but to the door that allows access to it.</p>
<p><img src="/img/room1.png" alt="room1"></p>
<p>Which means that your room can have many doors with different properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>A door for maintenance,</li>
<li>A door for guests,</li>
<li>And so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the floor (subnet) your door have a unique number called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address</a></p>
<p>In other words, your room is identified by an door number rather than a room number within a subnet.</p>
<pre><code>room -&gt; door 1 -&gt; room 69
</code></pre>
<p>or as a relation between Computer, MAC and IP</p>
<pre><code>computer interface eth0 -&gt; ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff -&gt; 192.168.6.9
</code></pre>
