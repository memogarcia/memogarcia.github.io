If you look at biology, evolution has found a way to design its systems in a way that each component has a defined interface to communicate, and more importantly, each component is free to “experiment” or evolve independently from each other by random mutations.
When changes in one component require a new interface it propagates those “requirements” to the other components in a trial-and-error mechanism."><link rel=canonical href=https://memo.mx/posts/complexity/><meta name=google-site-verification content="G-ZRB1GGCC9B"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d1467e28595903f993a7e37893057cefe5f69aece461c850796bf5b0a3bf422a.css integrity="sha256-0UZ+KFlZA/mTp+N4kwV87+X2muzkYchQeWv1sKO/Qio=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://memo.mx/%20favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://memo.mx/%20favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://memo.mx/%20favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://memo.mx/%20apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://memo.mx/%20safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content=" #2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content=" #2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://memo.mx/posts/complexity/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ZRB1GGCC9B"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-ZRB1GGCC9B")}</script><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Posts","item":"https://memo.mx/posts/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Is complexity a human construct?","item":"https://memo.mx/posts/complexity/"}]}</script><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Is complexity a human construct?","name":"Is complexity a human construct?","description":"Or is it a perspective? is it the result of the human ego? or is it just a communication problem?\nIf you look at biology, evolution has found a way to design its systems in a way that each component has a defined interface to communicate, and more importantly, each component is free to “experiment” or evolve independently from each other by random mutations.\nWhen changes in one component require a new interface it propagates those “requirements” to the other components in a trial-and-error mechanism.","keywords":[],"articleBody":"Or is it a perspective? is it the result of the human ego? or is it just a communication problem?\nIf you look at biology, evolution has found a way to design its systems in a way that each component has a defined interface to communicate, and more importantly, each component is free to “experiment” or evolve independently from each other by random mutations.\nWhen changes in one component require a new interface it propagates those “requirements” to the other components in a trial-and-error mechanism.
