If you look at biology, evolution has found a way to design it systems in a way that each component have a defined interface to communicate and more importantly, each component is free to “experiment” or evolve independent from each other by random mutations.
When changes in one component require a new interface it propagate those “requirements” to the other components in a trial and error mechanism.">
