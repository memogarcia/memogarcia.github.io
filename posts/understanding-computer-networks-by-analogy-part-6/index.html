Use it as a sheet to refresh your memory on the concepts.\nThink in rooms, floors, buildings, and streets. You send an envelope from your room, the concierge guides it across floors and buildings, and the city directory helps you find the right address. When you outgrow your building, you rent a private floor in a hotel and keep your hallways private.\nThe Core Building Analogy Building: A local network (LAN) that you control. Room: A single device on the network (a computer, phone, server, etc.). Room Number: The private IP address of a device. Street Address: The public IP address of the entire network. Door: A network interface (like an Ethernet port or Wi-Fi card). Door Tag: The unique, physical MAC address of a network interface. Hallway: The physical connection medium (Ethernet cable, air for Wi-Fi). Hallway Width: The maximum bandwidth of the connection. Floor: A logical segment of the network, a subnet. Floor Manager: A network switch, responsible for directing traffic between rooms on the same floor. Elevator: The default gateway, the device that lets you leave your floor to reach other floors. Concierge: A router, the device that reads addresses and chooses the next best path for a message. Envelope: A packet, the unit of data containing both the message and addressing information. Mail Slot: A port number, which directs the packet to the correct application on a device. Languages: Protocols (TCP is formal, tracked registered mail; UDP is a quick, informal postcard). City Directory: The Domain Name System (DNS), which translates human-readable names into IP addresses. Security Guard: A firewall, which checks messages against a list of rules. The Cloud Hotel Analogy Hotel or Serviced Office: A cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure). Renting a Private Floor: Creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), your own isolated network within the cloud. Wings of the Floor: Subnets within your VPC. Private Service Door: A VPC Endpoint, allowing private access to the hotel’s own services (like the central storage warehouse). Main Public Entrance: An Internet Gateway, allowing two-way traffic to and from the public internet. Monitored Staff-Only Exit: A NAT Gateway, allowing private rooms to access the internet without being publicly exposed. Door Guards: Security Groups, a stateful firewall attached to a specific room (server). Hallway Rules: Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), a stateless firewall for an entire wing (subnet). Private Hallway to Another Company’s Floor: VPC Peering. Private Elevator to Your Own Office Building: A VPN connection or a Direct Connect/Interconnect link.

Hotel Branches in Other Cities: A multi-region architecture for disaster recovery and lower latency. Ordering Room Service: Using serverless functions (like AWS Lambda). Hiring Personal Ushers for Every Room: Implementing a service mesh. Appendix B: Expanded Glossary of Terms Access Control List (ACL) A list of rules, like a security guard’s checklist, that a network device uses to permit or deny traffic. In the cloud, a Network ACL (NACL) is a stateless version of this for an entire subnet (a hallway). Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) The protocol used on a floor to ask the question, “I have the room number (IP address), but who has the specific door tag (MAC address) for it?” For IPv6, this function is handled by NDP. Autonomous System (AS) A network or group of networks under a single administrative control, like a university campus or a major corporation’s entire network. The BGP protocol is used to exchange routing information between different Autonomous Systems. Bandwidth The maximum theoretical capacity of a network connection. The width of the hallway. Not to be confused with throughput, which is the actual, measured speed. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) The official routing protocol of the internet. It’s used to make routing decisions between large, independent networks (Autonomous Systems). It’s the council of concierges from all the different corporations in the city, agreeing on the major highways to use between districts. Certificate (TLS/SSL) An ID card used to prove a server’s identity online, signed by a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority). The server’s diplomatic credentials. Certificate Authority (CA) A trusted third party that issues and verifies identity certificates. The notary public of the internet. Collision In a shared medium like Wi-Fi, a collision occurs when two devices attempt to transmit at the exact same time, corrupting both messages. Two people in a crowded square talking at once. CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) The set of rules Wi-Fi devices use to avoid talking over each other in a shared space. It involves listening before you speak and waiting a random interval. Default Gateway The router on a local network that serves as the exit point for all traffic destined for other networks. The elevator that takes you to other floors or the lobby. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) The protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices when they join a network. The hotel’s front desk, which assigns you a room number when you check in. DNS (Domain Name System) The system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 142.250.190.78). The city directory. Encapsulation The process of wrapping data in successive layers of headers as it moves down the network stack. Putting a letter in a series of nested envelopes for different stages of its journey. Ephemeral Port A temporary port number selected from a range, used by a client for a single, specific conversation. The temporary mailbox number you use for a specific online order, to keep the replies separate from your regular mail. Ethernet The most common technology for wired local area networks (LANs). The standards that define how to build the hallways and doors. Firewall A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on a set of rules. The security guard in the lobby. Forward Secrecy A feature of modern cryptographic protocols (like TLS 1.3) that ensures that even if a server’s long-term secret key is compromised, past conversations cannot be decrypted. The agreement on a secret language in public that is only good for one day. Gateway Endpoint A type of VPC Endpoint that provides a private route to a major cloud utility (like AWS S3) by adding an entry to your floor’s main directory (the route table). IAM (Identity and Access Management) The framework and rules for managing who is allowed to do what within a cloud environment. The hotel’s security department, responsible for issuing employee badges and permissions. Interface Endpoint A type of VPC Endpoint that places a private door for a cloud service directly on your floor, giving it its own room number (private IP address) in your hallway. Internet Gateway (IGW) A VPC component that allows two-way communication between your VPC and the public internet. The hotel’s main public entrance. IP Address A unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network, used for routing packets. The room number. Latency The time it takes for a single piece of data to travel from its source to its destination, often measured in milliseconds. The travel time between two points. MAC Address A unique, permanent, physical identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC). The unique, unchangeable serial number stamped on a room’s door. Mutual TLS (mTLS) A type of authentication where both the client and the server present certificates and prove their identity to each other. The secret, two-way handshake used between personal ushers in a service mesh. NAT (Network Address Translation) A method that allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address. The building’s mail forwarding service, which rewrites the return address on outgoing mail. NAT Gateway A managed cloud service that allows devices in a private subnet to connect to the internet, but prevents the internet from initiating connections with those devices. The hotel’s monitored, staff-only exit. Network Access Control List (NACL) A stateless firewall for an entire subnet that controls traffic in and out based on a numbered list of rules. The general security rules posted at the entrance to an entire hallway or wing. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) A widely used interior routing protocol that finds the fastest path for traffic within a single organization’s network. The regular meeting where all the concierges on a corporate campus update each other on the fastest routes. Packet A small segment of a larger message, containing data and addressing information. An envelope. Port A number from 0-65535 that specifies which service or application a packet is intended for on a device. The mail slot on a door. Protocol A set of formal rules and customs governing how data is exchanged between devices. A shared language or code of etiquette. Router A device that forwards data packets between different networks, choosing the best path for the traffic. The concierge in the lobby. Routing Table A set of rules, often in a table, used by a router to determine where to forward packets. The concierge’s map and directory. Security Group (SG) A stateful firewall attached to a specific device (like a server) that controls traffic in and out. The personal security guard at a specific room’s door. Serverless A cloud computing model where the cloud provider runs the server and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Ordering room service instead of managing your own kitchen. Service Mesh A dedicated infrastructure layer for making service-to-service communication safe, fast, and reliable. The team of personal ushers assigned to every room. Subnet A logical subdivision of a larger network. A floor in the building. Switch A device that connects other devices on a local network and forwards packets to the correct destination within that network. The floor manager. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) A core protocol of the internet that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. Sending a package by registered mail with tracking. Throughput The actual, measured rate at which data is successfully transferred across a network. The number of people who actually make it down the hallway in a minute, accounting for congestion. TLS (Transport Layer Security) A cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end security of data sent between applications over the internet. The secret handshake ritual. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) A core protocol of the internet that is fast and lightweight but does not guarantee delivery or order. Sending a quick postcard. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) A secure, isolated private network that you define and control within a public cloud. Your private floor in the cloud hotel. VPC Endpoint A feature that enables private connections between your VPC and supported cloud services. The private service doors to the hotel’s amenities. VPC Flow Logs A feature that captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. The security cameras in the hallways. VPN (Virtual Private Network) A secure, encrypted connection over a public network, often used to connect a corporate office to the cloud. A private, secure subway line from your office to the hotel. Appendix C: Further Reading This book was designed to be a starting point. If you are ready to go deeper, the resources below are excellent next steps.\nFoundational Textbooks Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross Computer Networks by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and David J. Wetherall TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W. Richard Stevens and Kevin R. Fall Practical Guides Network Warrior by Gary A. Donahue Networking All-in-One For Dummies by Doug Lowe Appendix D: Troubleshooting Playbook When something breaks, do not guess. Follow the envelope. The key is to test the path methodically, boundary by boundary.\nCore Loop: Address, Path, Permission The Sender’s Room: Confirm the application itself can reach the local network. Can it resolve DNS? Does it have a valid IP address from the leasing desk (DHCP)? Does it know the address of the elevator (the default gateway)? The Sender’s Door Guard (Security Group / Host Firewall): Is the guard at the sender’s own door allowing this type of outbound traffic on this specific mail slot (port)? The Hallway Rules (NACL): Are there any general rules for this entire wing of the floor that would block this type of traffic (either outbound or on the return path)? The Floor’s Directory (Route Table): Does the concierge’s map for this floor have a valid next hop for the destination address? The Building’s Exit (NAT/Internet Gateway): Is the exit door healthy? If using a NAT Gateway, are you running out of available mail forwarding slots (port exhaustion)? The Receiver’s Door Guard (Security Group): Is the guard at the destination room allowing inbound traffic from your address on this specific mail slot? Observe: Use the hallway cameras (VPC Flow Logs) and the concierge’s logbook (metrics) at each boundary to see exactly where the envelope was dropped or rejected. Expanded Walkthrough Scenario Problem: Your newly deployed application, running in a private room (a private subnet in your VPC), needs to download a critical security update from the internet, but the connection is failing.\nSender’s Room: You check the application’s logs. It says Connection timed out when trying to reach updates.vendor.com. You log into the server. A ping to the vendor fails. A dig updates.vendor.com command successfully resolves to an IP address. So, the room has a number and can use the city directory (DNS), but can’t get a letter out. Sender’s Door Guard (Security Group): You check the Security Group attached to your application’s server. The outbound (egress) rules show Allow All to 0.0.0.0/0. The guard is not blocking the exit. So far, so good. The Hallway Rules (NACL): You check the Network ACL associated with your private subnet. The outbound rule allows all traffic. However, you check the inbound rule. NACLs are stateless, so you need to explicitly allow the return traffic. The inbound rules only allow traffic from other rooms on your floor. They do not have a rule to allow return traffic from the internet (from the high-numbered ephemeral ports). This is a likely culprit. You add an inbound rule to the NACL to allow return traffic in the ephemeral port range (1024-65535). The Floor’s Directory (Route Table): You check the route table for your private subnet. It has a default route (0.0.0.0/0) that points to a NAT Gateway. This is correct. The room knows to use the monitored, staff-only exit. The Building’s Exit (NAT Gateway): You check the NAT Gateway’s metrics in the cloud provider’s console. You see no errors and very little traffic. It seems healthy, but no traffic is reaching it. Resolution: After adding the inbound rule to the NACL (Step 3), you try the connection again from the server. Success! The update downloads. The problem was that while your letter could leave the building via the NAT Gateway, the reply from the vendor was being blocked by the stateless hallway rules, which didn’t have an explicit exception for return mail. Appendix E: Ports and Protocols Quick Table Use this as a pocket guide for common services. It is not exhaustive, just a helpful starting point.\nService Protocol Port(s) Notes HTTP TCP 80 Cleartext web HTTPS TCP/UDP 443 HTTP/3 uses QUIC over UDP DNS UDP/TCP 53 UDP for queries, TCP for zone xfer SSH TCP 22 Remote shell SMTP TCP 25 Mail transfer IMAPS TCP 993 Secure IMAP POP3S TCP 995 Secure POP3 NTP UDP 123 Time sync SNMP UDP 161, 162 Monitoring and traps RDP TCP/UDP 3389 Remote Desktop MySQL TCP 3306 Database PostgreSQL TCP 5432 Database MongoDB TCP 27017 Database Redis TCP 6379 In-memory store Kafka TCP 9092 Messaging S3 (HTTPS) TCP/UDP 443 Often via VPC endpoints in cloud WireGuard UDP 51820 VPN OpenVPN UDP/TCP 1194 VPN Appendix F: The Network Layers in Our Analogy The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a way of conceptualizing the different layers of a network. Here’s how those seven layers map to our building and city analogy.\nLayer OSI Name Analogy Function \u0026 Concepts 7 Application The Content of the Letter The actual message you are writing. HTTP, SMTP. 6 Presentation The Language and Formatting Is the letter in English or Spanish? Is it encrypted? 5 Session The Conversation Flow Starting and ending the conversation. The three-way handshake. 4 Transport Registered Mail vs. Postcard TCP (reliable) vs. UDP (fast). Port numbers (mail slots). 3 Network The City-Wide Postal Service Routing between buildings. IP addresses (street addresses). 2 Data Link The Floor-Level Mail Service Moving the letter down the hallway. MAC addresses (door tags). 1 Physical The Hallway Itself The physical cables, radio waves, and light pulses.

It says <code>Connection timed out</code> when trying to reach <code>updates.vendor.com</code>. You log into the server. A <code>ping</code> to the vendor fails. A <code>dig updates.vendor.com</code> command successfully resolves to an IP address. So, the room has a number and can use the city directory (DNS), but can&rsquo;t get a letter out.</li><li><strong>Sender&rsquo;s Door Guard (Security Group):</strong> You check the Security Group attached to your application&rsquo;s server. The outbound (egress) rules show <code>Allow All</code> to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>. The guard is not blocking the exit. So far, so good.</li><li><strong>The Hallway Rules (NACL):</strong> You check the Network ACL associated with your private subnet. The outbound rule allows all traffic. However, you check the <em>inbound</em> rule. NACLs are stateless, so you need to explicitly allow the return traffic. The inbound rules only allow traffic from other rooms on your floor. They do not have a rule to allow return traffic from the internet (from the high-numbered ephemeral ports). <strong>This is a likely culprit.</strong> You add an inbound rule to the NACL to allow return traffic in the ephemeral port range (1024-65535).</li><li><strong>The Floor&rsquo;s Directory (Route Table):</strong> You check the route table for your private subnet. It has a default route (<code>0.0.0.0/0</code>) that points to a <strong>NAT Gateway</strong>. This is correct. The room knows to use the monitored, staff-only exit.</li><li><strong>The Building&rsquo;s Exit (NAT Gateway):</strong> You check the NAT Gateway&rsquo;s metrics in the cloud provider&rsquo;s console. You see no errors and very little traffic. It seems healthy, but no traffic is reaching it.</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> After adding the inbound rule to the NACL (Step 3), you try the connection again from the server. Success! The update downloads. The problem was that while your letter could leave the building via the NAT Gateway, the reply from the vendor was being blocked by the stateless hallway rules, which didn’t have an explicit exception for return mail.</li></ol><h1 id=appendix-e-ports-and-protocols-quick-table>Appendix E: Ports and Protocols Quick Table<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#appendix-e-ports-and-protocols-quick-table>#</a></h1><p>Use this as a pocket guide for common services.
