An ISP is responsible for laying the roads (cables, fiber lines, wireless connections) that link your building to the rest of the city.

Just like you depend on water and electricity companies for everyday needs, you rely on your ISP to deliver internet access.\nIn networking terms: Your ISP provides the “last mile” connection, the pipeline that brings data from the global internet (the city) straight to your building’s doorstep. Infrastructure and Maintenance ISPs maintain and upgrade the infrastructure that keeps data flowing smoothly. When roads wear out or become too crowded, ISPs add new cables, improve existing links, and invest in better equipment. They also monitor traffic patterns and help ensure fair and steady data flow.\nThis investment and maintenance keep your connection stable and efficient. Without it, you’d experience slow speeds, frequent outages, or poor reliability.\nPeering and Interconnection Imagine multiple utility companies that operate in different parts of the city. To give you access everywhere, they form partnerships and connect their networks at certain points. This process, called peering, ensures that even if you’re signed up with one ISP, you can still reach buildings served by another ISP.\nIn networking terms: ISPs build or lease connections to each other at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). These “meeting places” let traffic flow smoothly across different networks, giving you access to content and services from all over the city and beyond. Different Tiers and Roles Not all ISPs are the same. Some are local providers who focus on getting you connected at home. Others are large “Tier 1” ISPs who provide the backbone infrastructure connecting entire regions or countries. These top-tier ISPs are like massive highway developers, running huge pipes of bandwidth to ensure that everyone else can build their smaller roads off of them.\nLocal ISP: Brings the “last mile” connection directly to your building. Regional ISP: Covers a bigger area, often connecting multiple local ISPs. Tier 1 ISP: Runs the main highways of the internet, ensuring global coverage. Enabling Global Communication Ultimately, ISPs are the reason your building can talk to any other building in the world. They maintain and expand the web of roads, highways, and tunnels (fiber, cables, wireless links) that let data travel far and wide. By doing so, they empower you to reach beyond your own four walls, floors, and networks—into the vast city of the internet.\n",
