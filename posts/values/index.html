<p>soul
don&rsquo;t be afraid to mix work and life
remember your work is what you left behind
is what you share with others</p>
<p>authenticity
is not being unique, is to speak for yourself
say no when you mean it
understand WHY you do things, not only how
form your own opinions
the fact that you have an opinion, doesnt make it better than someone else</p>
<p>strive to improve
don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail
your enemy should become your teacher
rival vs competitor
always learn something new
NEVER NEVER NEVER laught at ignorance because is the thing you know who has it but you never know if you have it.</p>
<p>teach</p>
<p>respect
empaty
sonder
your work
other people&rsquo;s time
is the only thing they cannot recover</p>
<p>simple living
minimalist
consume local and in season
improve the economy by make it more distributed</p>
<p>values
make your decisions based on your values
people can depend on you if you are consistent</p>
<p>rest
sleep
travel
disconnect from work
computers, screens</p>
<p>have a clear vision, don&rsquo;t be obsesed with the road because that could change, your vision should stay the same</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>but more importantly, how to follow?</p>
<p>I want to be like Rodrigo or Spike, but does my life style allows this?
how to let more art in my life?</p>
<p>how to write this post?</p>
<p>What makes people consistent?</p>
