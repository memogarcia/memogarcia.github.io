This is the “full movie” of a typical HTTPS request from your laptop to a cloud-hosted web application.\nYou type a URL in your browser\nApplication layer: your browser prepares an HTTP request. DNS lookup – finding the building\nBrowser / OS ask a DNS resolver: “What is the IP for www.example.com?” DNS replies with an IP address (the building address). Deciding whether to leave the floor\nYour device checks: “Is this IP on my floor (subnet)?” If not, it sends the packet to the default gateway (elevator lobby). Leaving the building\nThe gateway/concierge (router) looks at the destination IP and chooses a next hop. Routers along the path repeat this step, forwarding the packet across the city until it reaches the cloud provider’s edge. Entering the cloud hotel\nThe provider’s edge routers route traffic towards the correct region and VPC. The Internet Gateway acts as the main entrance to your VPC floor. Finding the right room inside the VPC\nThe VPC’s routing tables decide which subnet (wing) the packet should go to. Within the subnet, ARP (or its cloud equivalent) resolves the MAC address of the target VM or load balancer. TLS handshake – setting up a secure tunnel\nYour browser and the server run the TLS ceremony: Exchange hellos and supported ciphers. Server presents its certificate; browser verifies the chain. Both sides perform a key exchange and agree on a shared secret. After the handshake, application data (HTTP) is encrypted. Service-to-service calls (optional, inside the mesh)\nThe front-end service may call other internal services: Each service talks to its sidecar proxy (usher). Proxies use mutual TLS and routing rules to reach other services. Observability and policy are enforced at this layer. Response travels back\nThe server sends an encrypted HTTP response back through the same tunnel. Packets retrace the path in reverse: subnet → VPC router → Internet Gateway → city routers → your default gateway → your room. Your browser renders the result\nDecrypts TLS. Interprets the HTTP response. Draws the page on your screen. Use this sequence when you want to debug “where things might be going wrong.”\nAppendix B – Glossary (Analogy-Aware) This glossary is written so you can jump between analogy and technical term quickly.\nEach entry has:\nAnalogy – how it appeared in the story. Meaning – what it is in networking terms. Why it matters – where you see it in real systems. B.1 Core Networking Host\nAnalogy: A room in the building. Meaning: Any device with a network stack (server, laptop, phone, VM, container). Why it matters: Hosts originate and receive traffic; all higher-level concepts eventually involve hosts. Network Interface (NIC)\nAnalogy: The door of the room. Meaning: A hardware or virtual interface that sends/receives frames (e.g. eth0, wlan0). Why it matters: IP addresses are bound to interfaces; troubleshooting often starts here. MAC Address\nAnalogy: The unique label on a specific door. Meaning: A link-layer address (typically 48 bits) used on Ethernet/Wi-Fi to deliver frames on a local segment. Why it matters: Switches and Wi-Fi access points use MAC addresses to decide where to send frames. IP Address\nAnalogy: Floor + room number. Meaning: A logical address (IPv4 or IPv6) used at the network layer to route packets across multiple networks. Why it matters: Routers use IP addresses and prefixes to decide paths; most debugging starts with “which IP are we talking to?” Subnet\nAnalogy: A floor in the building. Meaning: A group of IP addresses that share a common prefix and can talk directly over one link-layer domain. Why it matters: Subnets define broadcast domains, routing boundaries, and security zones. Default Gateway\nAnalogy: Elevator lobby leading out of the floor. Meaning: A router that handles traffic destined for IP addresses not on the local subnet. Why it matters: If the default gateway is misconfigured or unreachable, everything “outside the floor” breaks. Router\nAnalogy: Concierge in the lobby with a map. Meaning: A device that forwards packets between networks based on routing tables. Why it matters: The internet works because routers agree on routes and forward traffic accordingly. Routing Table\nAnalogy: The concierge’s binder of directions. Meaning: A set of rules that map destination prefixes to next hops and interfaces. Why it matters: When paths fail, misconfigured routes are often the culprit. Static Route\nAnalogy: A hand-written rule in the binder. Meaning: A manually configured entry in the routing table that does not change automatically. Why it matters: Simple and predictable in small networks; dangerous if left unmaintained in dynamic environments. Dynamic Routing Protocol (IGP/EGP)\nAnalogy: Concierges calling each other to update maps. Meaning: Protocols like OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP (IGPs) and BGP (EGP) that share route information between routers. Why it matters: They keep large networks and the internet usable without manual updates everywhere. DNS (Domain Name System)\nAnalogy: City directory or phone book. Meaning: A distributed database that maps names (like example.com) to records (IP addresses, mail servers, etc.). Why it matters: Users think in names, not IPs; almost every internet interaction involves DNS. B.2 Performance and Reliability Bandwidth\nAnalogy: Width of the hallway. Meaning: The theoretical maximum rate at which data can be transferred over a link (e.g. 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps). Why it matters: Sets the upper bound on throughput; relevant when links are saturated. Throughput\nAnalogy: How many people actually pass through the hallway per second. Meaning: The actual observed rate of successful data delivery over a link. Why it matters: Reflects real capacity after overhead, protocol behaviour, and congestion. Latency\nAnalogy: Travel time from one door to another. Meaning: The time it takes for a small piece of data to travel from source to destination. Why it matters: Critical for interactive applications, trading systems, and user experience. Jitter\nAnalogy: How much travel times vary from minute to minute. Meaning: Variation in latency between packets. Why it matters: High jitter is painful for voice/video and real-time gaming. TTL (Time To Live)\nAnalogy: Maximum number of buildings an envelope may pass before being discarded. Meaning: A counter in the IP header that decreases at each router; when it reaches zero the packet is dropped. Why it matters: Prevents routing loops from clogging the network; used by tools like traceroute. B.3 Transport and Security TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)\nAnalogy: Registered mail with tracking and acknowledgments. Meaning: A reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol providing ordered, loss-free delivery. Why it matters: Backbone of web browsing, email, and many other protocols where data integrity is essential. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)\nAnalogy: Simple postcard in the mail. Meaning: A connectionless transport protocol with minimal overhead and no built-in reliability. Why it matters: Ideal when freshness and low latency matter more than perfect delivery (streaming, gaming, DNS). QUIC\nAnalogy: A new, efficient courier service running on top of the regular post. Meaning: A modern transport protocol built over UDP with built-in encryption, multiplexing, and congestion control; foundation for HTTP/3. Why it matters: Reduces connection setup time and improves performance on lossy networks. TLS (Transport Layer Security)\nAnalogy: Diplomatic ceremony plus sealed envelope. Meaning: Cryptographic protocol that provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication between two endpoints. Why it matters: Protects almost all secure web and API traffic. Mutual TLS (mTLS)\nAnalogy: Both sides show ID badges, not just the building. Meaning: A variant of TLS where both client and server present and verify certificates. Why it matters: Foundation for zero-trust internal networking and service meshes. B.4 Cloud and Mesh VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)\nAnalogy: Your private floor in the cloud hotel. Meaning: A logically isolated virtual network within a cloud region. Why it matters: Provides network-level separation, custom IP addressing, and control over routing/gateways. Internet Gateway (IGW)\nAnalogy: Public lobby entrance to your floor. Meaning: A managed gateway that connects a VPC to the public internet. Why it matters: Necessary for publicly accessible services and outbound internet traffic from public subnets. NAT Gateway\nAnalogy: Staff-only back door. Meaning: A managed gateway that allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound internet connections while remaining unreachable from the internet. Why it matters: Lets private resources get updates or call external APIs without being exposed. VPC Endpoint\nAnalogy: Private service door to hotel amenities. Meaning: A private connection from a VPC to specific cloud services (storage, queues, etc.) without traversing the public internet. Why it matters: Improves security, reduces exposure, and can lower data-transfer costs. IAM (Identity and Access Management)\nAnalogy: Badge and keycard system. Meaning: The service that defines who or what may access which resources and under which conditions. Why it matters: Central to least-privilege access and security at scale. Service Mesh\nAnalogy: Network of personal ushers in the hallways. Meaning: A dedicated infrastructure layer (sidecar proxies + control plane) that handles service-to-service communication, security, and observability. Why it matters: Simplifies application code and centralises cross-cutting network concerns. Appendix C – Troubleshooting Checklist Use this checklist when “the network” feels broken. The idea is to move from room to city to cloud hotel in a structured way.\nC.1 Inside the Room Is the device actually up?\nDoes the operating system see the network interface? Is Wi-Fi enabled or is the cable properly plugged in? Does the device have an IP address?\nCheck: Interface status (up/down). IP address and subnet mask. Default gateway. Can you reach your own door and floor?\nPing your own IP (loopback or interface). Ping another host on the same subnet. If you can’t reach neighbours on the same floor, focus on:\nLocal firewall rules. Switch/Wi-Fi configuration. VLAN assignment for that port or SSID. C.2 Leaving the Building Can you reach the default gateway (elevator lobby)?\nPing the gateway’s IP. If ARP fails or pings time out, investigate: Cabling/switch ports. VLAN configuration. Gateway health. Can the gateway reach the outside world?\nFrom the gateway (or a device just behind it), try: Pinging an external IP (e.g. a known public DNS server). Traceroute to see where the path breaks. If you lose packets immediately after the gateway, look at:\nUpstream router configuration. Routing tables and static routes. Firewall rules at the perimeter. C.3 Name Resolution and Certificates Does DNS work? Try resolving a hostname with dig, nslookup, or browser tools. Compare: “Can I reach the IP directly?” vs “Can I reach the name?” If IP works but name doesn’t:\nCheck: Which DNS servers your device is using. DNS firewall or filtering policies. Misconfigured search domains. Is TLS failing? Symptoms: Browser warnings about insecure certificates. Client libraries complaining about handshake errors. Check: Certificate validity period. Certificate names (subject / SAN) vs hostnames. Trust chain and root CAs. C.4 Inside the Cloud Hotel Are routes and gateways correct in the VPC?\nLook at: VPC CIDR ranges. Subnet route tables (public vs private). Internet Gateway / NAT Gateway attachment. Are Security Groups and Network ACLs blocking traffic?\nConfirm: Inbound rules for the relevant ports and protocols. Outbound rules (sometimes overlooked). Use: VPC flow logs or equivalent diagnostics, if available. Are VPC Endpoints configured as expected?\nFor traffic to cloud services: Check endpoint policies. Ensure correct route table entries send traffic to the endpoint. C.5 Inside the Mesh Is the service mesh intercepting traffic?\nConfirm: Sidecar injection status for pods/instances. mTLS policies (do they match both sides?). Retry / timeout rules that might cause unexpected behaviour. Check observability data from the mesh\nLook for: Per-service error rates. Latency spikes between specific pairs of services. Circuit breakers opening. Use this appendix as a decision tree, not a blunt checklist. Start at the level where the failure first appears and move one layer down or up as needed.\n","wordCount":"2304","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-10-18T22:39:16+09:00","dateModified":"2025-11-13T22:11:49+09:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Memo

relevant when links are saturated.</li></ul><p><strong>Throughput</strong></p><ul><li>Analogy: How many people actually pass through the hallway per second.</li><li>Meaning: The actual observed rate of successful data delivery over a link.</li><li>Why it matters: Reflects real capacity after overhead, protocol behaviour, and congestion.</li></ul><p><strong>Latency</strong></p><ul><li>Analogy: Travel time from one door to another.</li><li>Meaning: The time it takes for a small piece of data to travel from source to destination.</li><li>Why it matters: Critical for interactive applications, trading systems, and user experience.</li></ul><p><strong>Jitter</strong></p><ul><li>Analogy: How much travel times vary from minute to minute.</li><li>Meaning: Variation in latency between packets.</li><li>Why it matters: High jitter is painful for voice/video and real-time gaming.</li></ul><p><strong>TTL (Time To Live)</strong></p><ul><li>Analogy: Maximum number of buildings an envelope may pass before being discarded.</li><li>Meaning: A counter in the IP header that decreases at each router; when it reaches zero the packet is dropped.</li><li>Why it matters: Prevents routing loops from clogging the network; used by tools like <code>traceroute</code>.</li></ul><h3 id=b3-transport-and-security>B.3 Transport and Security<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#b3-transport-and-security>#</a></h3><p><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong></p><ul><li>Analogy: Registered mail with tracking and acknowledgments.</li><li>Meaning: A reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol providing ordered, loss-free delivery.</li><li>Why it matters: Backbone of web browsing, email, and many other protocols where data integrity is essential.</li></ul><p><strong>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</strong></p><ul><li>Analogy: Simple postcard in the mail.</li><li>Meaning: A connectionless transport protocol with minimal overhead and no built-in reliability.</li><li>Why it matters: Ideal when freshness and low latency matter more than perfect delivery (streaming, gaming, DNS).</li></ul><p><strong>QUIC</strong></p><ul><li>Analogy: A new, efficient courier service running on top of the regular post.</li><li>Meaning: A modern transport protocol built over UDP with built-in encryption, multiplexing, and congestion control;
