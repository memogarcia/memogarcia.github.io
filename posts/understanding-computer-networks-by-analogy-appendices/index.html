Everyone was staring at you. You had no idea where to start.\nLet’s replay that scenario with what you know now.\nThe symptoms: nothing internal is working. Email down, Slack down, internal apps down. But people’s phones are fine on cellular data.\nYou check your laptop’s configuration. You have an IP address. That’s good. DHCP is working and you have a room number. You can ping the default gateway. That’s good. You can reach the elevator lobby. You try to ping an external IP, something simple like 1.1.1.1. That works too. So the path to the outside world is fine.\nYou try to ping an external hostname, like google.com. It fails.\nDNS is broken.\nYou check which DNS server you’re using. It’s an internal server, 192.168.1.10. You try to reach that server directly. No response. You look at the monitoring dashboard (because by now, your company has one). The DNS server is unreachable. It went down thirty minutes ago when someone accidentally deleted it during a “cleanup.”\nThe fix is straightforward. Temporarily point your laptop’s DNS to a public resolver like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8. Services start working. Then restore the internal DNS server from backup, or spin up a new one, or fix whatever configuration mistake took it down.\nYou identified the layer (DNS), located the failure (internal DNS server unreachable), and applied a workaround (use external DNS temporarily) while working on the real fix.\nThat’s the power of understanding the network. Not that you can solve every problem instantly, but that you know where to look. You have a mental model that tells you: check addresses, check paths, check permissions. Work from your room outward toward the destination. When something fails, you’ve narrowed down which layer and which component.\nA Final Word You’ve traveled far.\nYou started in a single room, learning about doors and hallways. You moved up to floors and subnets, understanding why networks are divided and how devices communicate within and between segments.\nYou left the building and explored the city. You met concierges and routing tables. You followed envelopes through the postal system. You learned about registered mail and postcards, TCP and UDP. You discovered the city directory, DNS, and saw how names become addresses.\nYou checked into the hotel, the cloud. You designed your own private floor with public and private wings. You installed doors to the outside world, from the main entrance to the staff exit to the private service corridors. You learned about badges and permissions.\nYou added sophistication. Wireless markets and the etiquette of shared airwaves. Diplomatic ceremonies and the protection of TLS. Personal ushers and the service mesh.\nAnd you ran the experiments yourself. You pinged and traced and listened and sent.\nThe network isn’t a black box anymore. It’s a building you can walk through, a city you can navigate, a hotel you can manage.\nThe next time someone says “it’s the network,” you’ll know what that means.\nBetter yet, you’ll know what to do next.\nAppendix A: The Whole Journey at a Glance Layers by Analogy Layer (TCP/IP) Analogy Examples Application People talking in rooms HTTP, DNS, SSH, SMTP Transport Conversation style TCP, UDP, QUIC Network City-wide addressing IP, ICMP, routing Link Hallways and local rules Ethernet, Wi-Fi, VLANs, ARP The Complete Analogy Map Concept Analogy Network Term Room A single device Host, server, laptop Door Network interface NIC, eth0, wlan0 Door label Physical door ID MAC address Room number Number on the door IP address Floor Group of nearby rooms Subnet Building One physical building LAN, on-prem network Elevator lobby Exit from the floor Default gateway Concierge Person routing mail Router Street network Roads and intersections The Internet City directory Phone/address book DNS Hotel chain Global managed buildings Cloud provider Private floor Your reserved hotel floor VPC Public wing Street-facing rooms Public subnet Private wing Back-office rooms Private subnet Main entrance Lobby open to street Internet Gateway Staff exit Back door for employees NAT Gateway Private service door Internal corridor to amenities VPC Endpoint Badge/keycard Identity and permissions IAM Personal usher Helper outside each room Sidecar proxy End-to-End Request Flow When your browser requests a webpage:\nYour browser prepares an HTTP request at the application layer.\nDNS resolves the hostname to an IP address.\nYour device checks if the destination is local (same subnet) or remote.\nIf remote, the packet goes to the default gateway.\nRouters forward the packet hop by hop across the internet, each one making a local decision about the next hop.\nThe packet reaches the cloud provider’s edge and is routed to the correct region and VPC.\nThe Internet Gateway admits traffic to the VPC.\nVPC routing sends the packet to the correct subnet.\nARP (or its cloud equivalent) resolves the target’s MAC address.\nYour browser and the server perform the TLS handshake.\nEncrypted HTTP data flows through the established tunnel.\nInternal services may communicate through a service mesh with mutual TLS.\nThe response travels back through the same path in reverse.\nYour browser decrypts and renders the result.\nAppendix B: Glossary ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): The “who lives here?” shout that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.\nBandwidth: The width of the hallway. How much data can flow through per second.\nBGP (Border Gateway Protocol): The diplomatic protocol routers use to exchange routes between organizations on the internet.\nCIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): Notation for IP addresses and their subnet masks, like 192.168.1.0/24.\nDefault Gateway: The elevator lobby. The router that handles traffic destined for other networks.\nDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): The front desk that assigns room numbers (IP addresses) when you check in.\nDNS (Domain Name System): The city directory that turns names into addresses.\nEncapsulation: Wrapping data in layers of headers, like putting a letter in an envelope in a bigger envelope.\nEphemeral Port: A temporary mail slot your device uses for outbound connections.\nFirewall: A guard that filters traffic based on rules about source, destination, and port.\nIAM (Identity and Access Management): The badge and keycard system that controls who can do what.\nInternet Gateway: The main entrance connecting a VPC to the public internet.\nIP Address: The room number that identifies a device on the network.\nLatency: The length of the hallway. How long data takes to travel from source to destination.\nMAC Address: The permanent serial number on a door, identifying a specific network interface.\nMTU (Maximum Transmission Unit): The largest package that fits through the hallway without being broken up.\nMutual TLS (mTLS): TLS where both sides present and verify certificates, not just the server.\nNAT (Network Address Translation): Rewriting addresses at the building exit so internal room numbers stay private.\nNAT Gateway: The staff exit that allows outbound connections from private resources.\nOSPF (Open Shortest Path First): A routing protocol for finding efficient paths within an organization.\nPacket: An envelope of data with headers and payload.\nPort: A mail slot on a device, directing traffic to a specific application.\nQUIC: A modern transport protocol built on UDP with built-in encryption and reliability.\nRouter: A concierge with a map that forwards packets toward their destination.\nRouting Table: The concierge’s binder of directions for where to send traffic.\nSecurity Group: A door guard in the cloud that filters traffic to specific instances.\nService Mesh: A network of personal ushers (sidecar proxies) that handle service-to-service communication.\nSidecar Proxy: An usher outside each room that handles network concerns on behalf of the application inside.\nSocket: The combination of IP address and port that identifies one end of a connection.\nSubnet: A floor in the building. A group of IP addresses that can communicate directly.\nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Registered mail. Reliable, ordered delivery with acknowledgments.\nTLS (Transport Layer Security): The diplomatic ceremony that provides encryption and authentication.\nTTL (Time To Live): A counter that prevents packets from circulating forever if routes are broken.\nUDP (User Datagram Protocol): A postcard. Fast, simple, with no delivery guarantees.\nVLAN (Virtual LAN): A logical floor painted on top of physical infrastructure.\nVPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Your private floor in the cloud hotel.\nVPC Endpoint: A private door connecting your VPC directly to cloud provider services.\nAppendix C: Troubleshooting Checklist When the network seems broken, work from inside out.\nInside Your Room Is your device on? Does the operating system see the network interface?\nDo you have an IP address? Check your interface configuration.\nCan you ping yourself (127.0.0.1)?\nCan you ping another device on the same subnet?\nIf local traffic fails, check cables, Wi-Fi connection, VLAN assignment, and local firewall rules.\nLeaving the Building Can you ping your default gateway?\nIf the gateway is unreachable, check physical connectivity, ARP resolution, and gateway health.\nCan the gateway reach external destinations?\nIf external pings fail from the gateway, check upstream routing, ISP connectivity, and perimeter firewalls.\nName Resolution Does DNS work? Can you resolve a hostname?\nIf ping by IP works but by name fails, your DNS is the problem.\nCheck which DNS servers you’re using. Try a known public DNS server (1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8).\nCertificates and TLS Is the certificate valid and not expired?\nDoes the certificate name match the hostname you’re connecting to?\nIs the certificate signed by a trusted CA?\nCheck for clock skew on your device, which can make valid certificates appear invalid.\nInside the Cloud Are VPC routes correct? Does the public subnet route to the Internet Gateway?\nDoes the private subnet route to a NAT Gateway for outbound access?\nAre Security Groups allowing the expected traffic, both inbound and outbound?\nAre Network ACLs interfering with stateful connections?\nAre VPC Endpoints correctly associated with route tables?\nInside the Mesh Are sidecar proxies injected correctly?\nAre mTLS policies consistent between services?\nCheck proxy logs for connection errors.\nLook for circuit breakers opening or retry exhaustion in metrics.\nYou’ve reached the end. The network is no longer a mystery. Go build something.\n","wordCount":"1683","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-10-18T22:39:16+09:00","dateModified":"2025-12-01T22:47:54+09:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Memo Garcia"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://memo.mx/posts/understanding-computer-networks-by-analogy-appendices/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Memo Garcia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://memo.mx/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://memo.mx/ accesskey=h title="Memo Garcia (Alt + H)">Memo Garcia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://memo.mx/labs/ title=Labs><span>Labs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li><li><a href=https://memo.mx/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Understanding Computer Networks by Analogy: Appendices</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-10-18 22:39:16 +0900 +0900'>October 18, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Memo Garcia</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#epilogue-full-circle aria-label="Epilogue: Full Circle">Epilogue: Full Circle</a><ul><li><a href=#chapter-19-the-day-you-knew-where-to-look aria-label="Chapter 19: The Day You Knew Where to Look">Chapter 19: The Day You Knew Where to Look</a></li><li><a href=#a-final-word aria-label="A Final Word">A Final Word</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#appendix-a-the-whole-journey-at-a-glance aria-label="Appendix A: The Whole Journey at a Glance">Appendix A: The Whole Journey at a Glance</a><ul><li><a href=#layers-by-analogy aria-label="Layers by Analogy">Layers by Analogy</a></li><li><a href=#the-complete-analogy-map aria-label="The Complete Analogy Map">The Complete Analogy Map</a></li><li><a href=#end-to-end-request-flow aria-label="End-to-End Request Flow">End-to-End Request Flow</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#appendix-b-glossary aria-label="Appendix B: Glossary">Appendix B: Glossary</a></li><li><a href=#appendix-c-troubleshooting-checklist aria-label="Appendix C: Troubleshooting Checklist">Appendix C: Troubleshooting Checklist</a><ul><li><a href=#inside-your-room aria-label="Inside Your Room">Inside Your Room</a></li><li><a href=#leaving-the-building aria-label="Leaving the Building">Leaving the Building</a></li><li><a href=#name-resolution aria-label="Name Resolution">Name Resolution</a></li><li><a href=#certificates-and-tls aria-label="Certificates and TLS">Certificates and TLS</a></li><li><a href=#inside-the-cloud aria-label="Inside the Cloud">Inside the Cloud</a></li><li><a href=#inside-the-mesh aria-label="Inside the Mesh">Inside the Mesh</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><blockquote><p>A quick-reference blueprint, glossary, and troubleshooting checklist for when you feel lost in the city.</p></blockquote><p>License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</p><hr><h1 id=epilogue-full-circle>Epilogue: Full Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#epilogue-full-circle>#</a></h1><h2 id=chapter-19-the-day-you-knew-where-to-look>Chapter 19: The Day You Knew Where to Look<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-19-the-day-you-knew-where-to-look>#</a></h2><p>Remember your first day?</p><p>The network was down.
