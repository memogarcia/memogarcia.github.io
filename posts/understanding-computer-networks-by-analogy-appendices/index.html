If you are ready to go deeper and explore the underlying technical details, the resources below are excellent next steps on your journey.\nThey are dense, technical, and comprehensive, and represent the gold standard of computer networking literature.\nAppendix D: Troubleshooting Playbook When something breaks, do not guess. Follow the envelope.\nCore Loop Sender room: confirm the app can reach the local network. Check IP/DHCP lease; default gateway; DNS resolver. Door guard (Security Group / host firewall): is egress allowed on the slot? Floor rules (NACL/ACL): any stateless deny on the subnet wing? Route table: is there a next hop for that destination? Boundary device: NAT/Internet Gateway/VPN/Direct Link healthy? Remote side: is the destination listening on that slot and allowed by its guard? Observe: VPC Flow Logs, metrics, and traces at each boundary. Mantra: address, path, permission. Verify each in order.\nCommon Patterns DNS mismatch: Name resolves to public when caller is private (or vice versa). Fix split-horizon DNS or endpoint usage. SG asymmetry: Egress allowed but return path blocked on remote ingress. Add reply rules or use stateful guards. NACL block: Stateless deny on ephemeral ports. Open ephemeral ranges or prefer stateful SGs. PMTUD black hole: ICMP blocked on path; large payloads fail. Allow needed ICMP or reduce MTU. NAT table exhaustion: Too many concurrent flows through one NAT. Scale or add another egress. Two Quick Walkthroughs Private app cannot reach public API Sender has IP and gateway. SG allows egress 443. NACL allows outbound and ephemeral return. Route points to NAT Gateway. NAT metrics show connections but no responses. VPC Flow Logs show REJECT at destination. Root cause: API provider only allows public IPs; add egress IP to allowlist or use a public-facing path. Web is slow for EU users Latency high from EU to single region. Metrics confirm high RTT. Fix by adding a nearby region, enable latency-based DNS, and put static assets behind a CDN so “corner shops” serve them locally. Keep logs on, change one thing at a time, and write down what you observe.\nFoundational Textbooks These are the academic cornerstones of networking. They are deep, thorough, and will give you a complete picture of the field.\nComputer Networking: A Top-Down Approach\nby James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross Why it’s useful: This book is beloved for its inverted approach, starting with the applications you use every day (like the web) and working its way down the network stack to the physical wires. It makes the material more intuitive for many learners. Computer Networks\nby Andrew S. Tanenbaum and David J. Wetherall Why it’s useful: A true classic, this book is a comprehensive and authoritative reference for nearly all aspects of networking, from theory to practice. It’s an essential part of any networking library. TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols\nby W. Richard Stevens and Kevin R. Fall Why it’s useful: When you absolutely need to understand the nitty-gritty details of how TCP/IP works, this is the book. It is famous for its clarity and in-depth protocol analysis. Practical Guides These books are more focused on the real-world tasks of building and managing networks.\nNetwork Warrior\nby Gary A. Donahue Why it’s useful: This book moves from theory to the practical realities of enterprise networking, focusing on the hardware, commands, and configurations you would encounter in a real job. Networking All-in-One For Dummies\nby Doug Lowe Why it’s useful: A very accessible and broad overview of the entire field, this book is great for filling in gaps and learning about the many different areas of networking without getting bogged down in deep theory.

Add reply rules or use stateful guards.</li><li>NACL block: Stateless deny on ephemeral ports. Open ephemeral ranges or prefer stateful SGs.</li><li>PMTUD black hole: ICMP blocked on path; large payloads fail.

SG allows egress 443. NACL allows outbound and ephemeral return. Route points to NAT Gateway. NAT metrics show connections but no responses. VPC Flow Logs show REJECT at destination. Root cause: API provider only allows public IPs; add egress IP to allowlist or use a public-facing path.</li></ul><ol start=2><li>Web is slow for EU users</li></ol><ul><li>Latency high from EU to single region.
