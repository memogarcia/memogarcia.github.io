And why Kubernetes “won”.
I owe my career to OpenStack and to all its contributors. I have made excellent friends, I learned a lot from them and the project itself.
For that and more, thanks a lot OpenStack.
However…
Even though OpenStack has never been better, I can’t shake the feeling that is fighting a lost battle."><link rel=canonical href=https://memo.mx/posts/is-openstack-losing/><meta name=google-site-verification content="G-ZRB1GGCC9B"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d1467e28595903f993a7e37893057cefe5f69aece461c850796bf5b0a3bf422a.css integrity="sha256-0UZ+KFlZA/mTp+N4kwV87+X2muzkYchQeWv1sKO/Qio=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://memo.mx/%20favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://memo.mx/%20favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://memo.mx/%20favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://memo.mx/%20apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://memo.mx/%20safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#0d0221"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#0d0221"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://memo.mx/posts/is-openstack-losing/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ZRB1GGCC9B"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!0&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-ZRB1GGCC9B")}</script><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Posts","item":"https://memo.mx/posts/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Is OpenStack fighting a lost battle?","item":"https://memo.mx/posts/is-openstack-losing/"}]}</script><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Is OpenStack fighting a lost battle?","name":"Is OpenStack fighting a lost battle?","description":"Update Jan 2023: Is OpenStack Still Needed in 2022? - Thierry Carrez, Open Infrastructure Foundation\nAnd why Kubernetes “won”.\nI owe my career to OpenStack and to all its contributors.
